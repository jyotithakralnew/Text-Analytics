redbear,9/29/2016 16:38,(35-44),,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,0,I have add combine type  like most that have to be on medication when I start doing well I don't think I need it anymore. With Adderall I have been able to adjust my dosage as needed with dr approval of course but somedays I don't need to full amount. with add I feel like my brain is misfiring like with a car. With Adderall I feel its firing in the right direction atleast so I have the ability to function on all my cylinders if I need to. I don't want to switch to a different medication this one works great with my body chemistry

,8/24/2016 20:01,(65-74),,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,6,This drug has been a big help with my ADHD and negative moods.  I've been taking it for about 3 months and am now suffering from some of the side effects.  I become very tired a short time after taking my first dose and very run down.  I also find my self becoming mixed up and my memory also suffers.  I won't stop taking it because it does calm me down and allows me focus.  I take it when I am going to be in public.  At home I sometimes skip it just for a break and to bring back my mental clarity.
Momof3,8/16/2016 17:42,(25-34),,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,3,9,BEWARE!! This medicine is dangerous!! I was a 20mg of Addreal once a day for five years and it worked with no problems.  Within those five years I got pregnant and when off my meds during pregnancy. Two months After the birth of my last child  I re-started my medicine and for some reason it didn't help as it did before. So I self-Medicaid  and take another pill.... Long story short  I became  dependent on the medication and could not go without it. I very quickly became addicted and started taking more and more. My mood changed  I was very   Aggressive and mean always yelling at my family my children would be scared of me I would lose my temper very quickly. Also This lead to no sleep  not eating  I became too thin  my hair started to fall out and became very thin and stringy. My husband didn't know what to think  and I became someone I didn't even know. I almost got my children taken away and a divorce.... Mortal of the story it changed my life upside down and I had to stop taking it!!! I have been working with my doctors and now I'm on vyvanse along with depression medicine and it works great!! Not addicting at all and helps me get my daily tasks done  care for my family and I'm finally getting back to myself
krissy2696,8/1/2016 12:23,(35-44),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Other,5,5,5,1,I have suffered with ADD for the majority of my life. It was very hard to stay on task. I went years undiagnosed. Now I'm able to stay focused at work  sit and read a book without distraction  and accomplish tasks I start and actually finish.

Brimanny,6/7/2016 22:07,(25-34),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,9,Adderall has been the most effective for me. I take 30 mg a day and it is perfect to get through the work way with the necessary focus and attention. It has also helped with my frustration issues with staff. I now have the ability to think clearly before I speak  and that has been a welcome change for my coworkers and subordinate staff!
Me,5/4/2016 13:10,(55-64),,None,5 to less than 10 years,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,5,5,5,0,Until I was placed on this medication  I found myself falling asleep just two hours after having a 10 hour night's sleep. I could not stay awake. After several tests  I was placed on Adderall oral. Two pills a day. A strong one upon awakening  I believe it was time released. A smaller dosage around 2 or 3 pm. I had no trouble sleeping. In fact it truly improved my life. I no longer have insurance coverage and had to ween myself from the medication. The quoted cost for this med is at least $800 a month in Co. and just under $400 in Wy. I cannot afford the out of pocket cost. Now  I am sleeping 16 hours a day and sometimes still opt for a nap. As you can see  without this medication  I am sleeping my life away. I wish it was more affordable. I really miss it.
DCC,4/20/2016 16:37,(55-64),Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,2,5,Taking twice a day but the second dose  even taken early afternoon  made it hard to get to sleep at night. Sometimes I would skip the second daily dose to get some sleep. it didn't seem to last very long. Maybe an hour or two as far as attention improvement. Causes continuous jaw clanching and movement.
Smalloni,4/1/2016 12:33,(55-64),Female,Caregiver,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,1,23,My son was changed from Ritalin to Adderall at age 13. After a short while of being on Adderall he became very angry and defiant. We thought that since he was going through puberty & dealing with ADHD that he was just having a rough time dealing with the chemistry changing in his body. As time went on he became more aggressive threatening to stab his father with a butcher knife & constantly going up against his dad & peers at school. He distroyed things in his path & punched holes in the walls of our home  yelling & cursing when anyone rubbed him the wrong way. The slightest things would set him off into fits of rage. He took on multiple personalities one being very evil as if Satan's son. He was a Jeckyll & Hyde.  This went on for 4 years as the dosage was increased because of his high tolerance to Adderall. After being in support groups & reading up I discovered other we're experiencing these very same side affects. I demanded the doctor to take him off of it and since he's been off of it for 6 months now & almost instantly I got my sweet boy back. I read that Adderall was like taking crystal meth. This medicine needs to be removed from the market permanently in my opinion. He was in & out of the hospital 4 times in a 3 months time frame. Not once had the doctors ever try taking him off the Adderall. All they did was ginnea pig him pumping him full of antipsychotic meds. He ended up for the first time in his life getting in trouble with the police for assault on an officer  resisting arrest & interfering with police business. Adderall is a very dangerous medication. If you benefit from it without the bad side affects  then that is good. If not  I would not take this medication.

Lagunagrl,3/7/2016 15:57,(55-64),,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,3,10,I started adderall in mid-2013. I felt I couldn't function w/out it even though my jaws were clenched more often than not. A few weeks ago I ended up in the ER with a blood pressure way too high and heart palpitations. The psychiatrist who prescribed this med for me had given me a 6 to 8 question survey for ADHD. THAT was the extent of her diagnosis. Never asked how my BP was or what other meds I was taking. I believe she is a source of adderall for students who attend university about a half-mile from her practice. She presents put together but I think she's missing a screw when it comes to being a smart and engaged psychiatrist.
WorriedWarrior,3/3/2016 17:56,(45-54),Female,Caregiver,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,1,3,5,2,"My story is a tad different. I work online with addicts  so have a warning for parents.
I am very concerned about the popular misuse of this drug by students. It enhances focus for studying but is very addictive. Many drug addicts promote it to their peers  and also tell them what to add to improve the 'rush'.
Please - don't let your children use this unless it is vital and justified  such as for narcolepsy or ADHD. And  if your child is addicted  defiant and refusing rehab  please learn to help him or her via e.g. an online course for parents with addict children such as Parent CRAFT (cadenceonline.com). I know I might sound like a crazy lady  but this drug is being widely abused by students and too many health care professionals prescribe it without caring about consequences."

brooke26,2/6/2016 23:21,(25-34),Female,Patient,10 years or more,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,51,"I have been taking Adderall for over about 17 years. Without this medication I would never have graduated high school  college  and be working on my second degree. Sometimes medication is the only option for those who try everything possible first. This drug is nothing to play with  it takes precise clock work  discipline and knowledge. You have to ensure you are keeping your body healthy when taking it. Yes  it does have side effects but yes it does work great for those who need this type of chemical balance. If you want to prevent the ""rush"" as some report  EAT first. Then  make sure you drink more than the minimum amount of water a day. I literally drink about 10 waters a day. Stay away from caffeine and make sure to NEVER take this med. at night unless you don't plan on sleeping  which is another thing to make sure you are getting enough of. A balanced diet  sleep  and overall life routine is important. I also wouldn't recommend you take it if you are going to a social event  because like me I'm not the socialist butterfly on it when I would normally talk an ear off. With proper care and balance this is the answer for most. It is my answer and I'm more than thankful I have gotten as far as I have and I am thankful for its creation. I hope this helps some and also to the mothers  when your child is on this med. it's best to leave them alone. They just want to focus and most likely won't want to eat. It's just how it made me and when they are ""coming down"" they will need something to pick them up..it's a horrible crash on the XR(extended release caps 8hr). I usually drink a soda or a coffee. Sometimes I will even take a 1/2 of my instant release(4 hr tabs) if I have school work still to help ease the crashing. Lots of water to prevent headaches and time the pills. I don't get the full 8 hours that some would  I'm about 4 hours and I begin to fade. My doctor has me prescribed 1 8hr cap in am(7am) and then by 12pm one 4hrtab  4pm one 4hrtab. single mom so long day"
SnoozyDoozy,2/5/2016 23:27,(25-34),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,4,4,4,1,After trying several other stimulants to treat my excessive daytime sleepiness due to Narcolepsy  I was put on Adderall XR. It is the only one that seemed to help me stay awake during the day. The only problem I have with this Rx is that you build up a tolerance to it.
Ella Leeds,1/20/2016 18:01,(13-18),,Patient,10 years or more,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,5,5,19,I've been on this medication since I was only 5 years old  I'm now 16. I started taking it because I couldn't focus/was very disruptive in Kindergarten. I stopped taking it when I was around 13/14 and went back on when I was 15. When I'm on the pill it really does help me focus  but sometimes I'm so focused that I get lost in what's happening around me. I can say that I'm more effective using it  but the side effects are terrible! Always feeling the need to throw up  not being able to eat  always dead tired by the end of the day  being unbelievably shaky and nervous for no reason  and it also links to depression. If you don't take the pill for a week or so it hits you hard

,12/4/2015 16:59,(19-24),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,3,9,This amphetamine salt was a nightmare  I was prescribed it as a child and didn't know the side effects yet still ended up spitting it into the bush outside my house a majority of times because of how it impacted my thinking and cranked me out. This type of drug is completely last resort and I would recommend anyone think twice before taking it

I have bipolar  anxiety  depression  panic attack  and many back issues.  I couldn't figure out why I couldn't stay focused or I was in bed 24/7 until I started taking Adderal I actually out of my  I can focus on tasks and get thing done.  I'm thankful my psych dr finally figured out it.
joeo,11/22/2015 11:26,(45-54),Male,None,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,17,I'm 52yrs old and taking 45mgs a day. I run 5 day's a week and never felt better. Cardio wise I'm in tip top shape  BP While on adderall at its peak is 125/82 pulse mid 70s (have BP machine at home)Pulse in morning when waking up 55-58 beats per minute(due to my running) BP 110/70..So for me after taking adderall in the morning about 2hrs after taking first dose it goes up slightly  but not alarming...So to answer peoples question about taking adderall AS YOU get older its all how you take care of yourself and Genetics  Coming from a family (on both sides) with no BP problems or heart conditions runs in my favor..Main thing eat right  keep your weight down and get active  Even a brisk walk 30 minutes a day will do the trick...
rangerwife,11/17/2015 15:24,(25-34),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,16,I tried 6 different ADHD medications that did not work before I started Adderall (diagnosed when I was 18). I wanted to avoid it if at all possible due to its stigma and popularity on the streets. I regret not trying it sooner because it works wonders for me! I am prescribed 30mg twice daily (i have severe ADHD) and it's really helpful. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I do find if I take it for an extended period of time it becomes less effective  but when that happens i'll stop taking it for about a week or two and it will go back to working like a charm. I'm so glad I am prescribed it  every aspect of my life has improved since taking Adderall. it made my ADHD easier to manage  my social life better  my marks increased significantly  and helped basically every negative symptom that comes with having ADHD. One downside I will mention  it is very expensive.
,11/14/2015 16:59,(45-54),Female,Caregiver,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,2,3,8,My 7 year old daughter tried this for ADHD.  This was the 8th ADHD we have tried and by far the worst.  She could not sleep for 37 hours.  She was picking at her skin and couldn't settle down.  We only did it one day and will not do again.
,11/5/2015 11:53,(45-54),Female,Patient,10 years or more,Other,5,5,5,2,Adderall helps me to stay focused which makes it easier to stay on task.
redboy,11/2/2015 10:51,(19-24),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,5,5,7,"in the short term it leaves you with a ease and you can focuses more but it in long term effects you ability to interact with others it makes you think before you act....on every thing so before you say something you have to think what will happen after you say it what could be said in response and in the time its taking you to finger this out 30  40 min pass by and you look as if you are ignoring some one or not willing to engage in conversation so as long as you arnt on this long enough to keep these habits when you stop taking it then you are good or better yet if you start taking it at an older age you might be able to not take effect to this so to all you parents I recommend not giving your child this simply because they are a little hyper because it could ""mess them up"" in the long run"
Guardmom,10/26/2015 2:50,(45-54),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,4,4,4,1,Narcolepsy type episodes after a concussion. 3rd shift worker in a job where I CANNOT doze off  and would doze off during the day  even after sleeping. Been on treatment for about 3 years. 20mg. 3x day. Has helped to where I can work and function in a normal way.

jam,10/16/2015 17:02,(55-64),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,3,3,4,4,There are times when it seems to work. But much of the time I do not notice any difference at all. There have been times when I actually question if I am getting a placebo med and not actually receiving the real med? I know that sounds really crazy but one should not fall asleep after taking one 30mg and a half og one or 45mg. If anyone has experienced anything similAR I would like to hear their story. Just trying to keep my eyes open during the day. I no longer will attempt a trip 120 miles away by myself for fear of nodding off. I take 3 30mg tabs per day. 1 1/2 twice a day.

At college had some help but told to use a recorder for notes. I did well  but I knew I needed more. This medication was my answerer.

Kingcleopatra,8/22/2015 3:15,(19-24),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,15,I just recently began getting treatment for my adhd. The first drug my psychologist prescribed me was  straterra  which is a non stimulant. I was suppose to take it 3 weeks but after 2 & 1/2 weeks I decided that was enough. I absolutely hated it ! It made me nauseated & constipated. It made me very tired  but I still couldn't sleep. It was not helping me concentrate and put me in a terrible mood. I went back to my psychiatrist and was prescribed adderall xr generic brand by Barr. It's amazing ! It's puts me in a great mood  I'm able to concentrate  and I'm not experiencing many side effects. Only thing I notice is it doesn't really last as long as it's suppose to. I work in a fast paced environment and I'm constantly running around dealing with patients which speeds up my metabolism and makes it wear off pretty fast. Also the first morning I took it I had to take 2 otc sleeping pills which I didn't feel until hours later. It's day 3 now and it was busy at work so it wore off fast. I got home and was ready to sleep  but here it is 2
Barry,8/18/2015 5:37,(35-44),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,20,I didn't find Adderall until I was halfway through college in my early 30's  it has been a God send! I don't have much of the hyperactivity but it simply allows me to concentrate on one thing at a time  something that I didn't know was even possible. I was drinking insane amounts of caffeine prior to starting which I found out was a way to self medicate. I don't take it everyday  only those that I need full concentration on items. The only drawbacks that I have found is I don't like eating after I take it  I grind my teeth and periodically have problems sleeping. Beyond that it is AWESOME!
,8/16/2015 20:14,(35-44),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,12,So far so good!  It has been one week and a big bonus was my improved mood.  I was very cynical before I started taking Adderall.  But most importantly I am definitely more alert and my mind is sharper.  I am so glad that I was prescribed!
,8/11/2015 19:18,(45-54),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,3,3,I have been on Adderall 20mg's for many years  and have not had any issues with it  except for forgetting to take it in the afternoon. My doctor took me off 20mg's three times a day  and knocked it down to twice a day  then down to once a day. Not that i am more active  and notice i become a bit out of it  of foggy in the afternoon  my doctor thought maybe the Adderall XR would be better  as i would only be taking it in the morning  but it would last all day.
StreetLeader,8/1/2015 22:46,(45-54),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,9,After 18 months of realizing something was wrong - no concentration  lack of focus  depressive moods  sleeping disorders and overall funk  I broke down and saw a doctor. He prescribed 30mg twice a day. WOW what a difference. I am staying on task  getting things done  people have noticed the upswing in mood and activity. Worst side effect is the tingling in feet and hands but workable. Loss of appetite - so I force myself to munch on healthy snacks during day. DRINK LOTS OF WATER. Dry mouth and grinding teeth does happen. Overall 4.5 stars.
,7/30/2015 7:07,(55-64),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,4,5,9,I have had the same experiences as just about every post in this blog. I was finally diagnosed as an adult with ADD in my late 40's. I have been on Strattera with little to no effect  Vyvanse and Adderall XR that didnt last through the day and now for the last 2 years have been on 40 mg of the regular Adderall  20 mg in a.m. 10 at noon and 10 at 4. However I found myself in a terrible slump last month  binge eating  anxiety attacks and all I wanted to do was sleep. Then one morning I accidentally took a double dose (40 mg).  Immediately my depression disappeared and I was able to get off my couch on the weekends and didn't dread going in to work.Since then I have been taking 30mg in the a.m. and 10-20mg in the afternoon. I have an appt. with my doc. in a few weeks to discuss this  but I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience and if so what did you do?

MomofMany,6/11/2015 17:00,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,5,5,I have suffered from ADHD my whole life. after having 4 kids  I decided to try meds again to help my focus. As a stimulant  Adderall gave me intense panic attacks  anxiety  and insomnia. I also completely lost my sense of humor. I felt like the anxiety and stress offset any benefits of focus I might have had related to the drug and after a month I had to switch. I found Strattera which is a non-stimulant MUCH more effective.

I'm more productive and focused at work. I'm starting to think though that my body is getting used to it so am talking to my Dr. about taking ""days off"" or changing the dose during the day.  Definitely worth trying if you are struggling with abnormal sleep patterns."
jbrill,6/2/2015 11:57,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,2,4,4,Diagnosed with ADD last fall - this was the first med I tried.  Almost 30 minutes on the nose after I would take it  I would feel it kick in.  I would get really hyper (ironically) and feel that I was working faster  but I didn't feel like it really helped with my attention and focus.  And then when it would wear off  I would crash really hard.  It would feel like I was coming down with the flu

Had i been diagnosed with all these earlier in life things would have been much easier. But i was on the extended release  didnt work for me but the immediate release was a life saver. I was so bad i may have lost my job from being so unproductive. I have been hospitalized 3 times and was immediately taken off of it  i was on 20mg 3x a day. Once they got me correctly diagnosed  my doctor started me back on it at 10mg 2x day and im a different person. I say its a miracle drug for me. It can be addictive though  so you just need to be careful and takeas directed.

I was able to get adderall XR 10 years ago but why can't I get it prescribed now? I was on it was almost 2 years. It helped me finish and follow through quality of life chores such as getting a job. Now the generic does barely anything. I know chemistry changes but what is really the ingredient?

After using it for 3.5 yrs  I still find it effective. I was given this drug only after reserching it and being proactive. I was my only advocate. My life would have been very different if I had been properly diagnosed and treated.
WantToBeActive,4/2/2015 20:39,(35-44),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,3,3,5,3,"I have had excessive daytime sleepiness since I was 12. I constantly feel exhausted and before Adderall  I longed to be able to take a nap (even if I slept 14 hours). That is what I looked forward to do. Sad. I asked my neurologist to let me try it and because he knows me (and my kooky  holistic  try NOT to take meds  gluten-free  sugar-free   organic diet-self) lol  he wrote the prescription. WOW!!!!! I have lost some weight  I have gotten VERY organized  I don't constantly think about when I will get to sleep. It takes about an hour for me to feel ""awake""  and for me  it only lasts about 2-3 hours. So  I break the 30 mg Adderall in half and take half at 7am  half at 12pm and try not to take any more. [The more you take  the more quickly your body adjusts to it and it seems like it doesn't work anymore.]. I try to NOT take it as often as possible. It is good to take a day off/week. Ask your doctor if you could take ""Nuvigil"" for your day off Adderall. It is nice to be able to feel ""normal"" and not totally exhausted. Just try to take as little as possible. And  try to take ""days off"" if possible."

It is absolutely 100% WORTHLESS. Drowsy  fatigue  ZERO help with concentration  etc.. Seriously 100% garabage. I did A LOT of research (after I came home from picking up script) and found numerous complaints about TEVAs ""fillers"" etc  that they put into this drug!!!  WHY DOES THE FDA ALLOW SUCH BS?? These are used (and NEEDED) to help so many people with serious issues of ADHD - yet  they (Teva) is allowed to sell products with the FDAs blessing that the drug can be 20% LESS EFFECTIVE than the Brand Name??  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!  

If you are perscribed 30mg XR - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and INSIST with your Dr. on getting the brand name (SHIRE) instead of this TEVA Generic GARBAGE!!  Cannot belive the FDA allows this (wonder how much they are getting paid to look the other way)!!!

TEVA ADERALL = GARBAGE! Save your money"
Amybee,3/10/2015 11:40,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Other,3,3,4,3,I was prescribed 15 mg twice a day for depression-related fatigue. I have stuck to just taking it once a day...It helped for several months then the effectiveness wore off. I have been off of the med for at least a week and I'm considering going back to taking it maybe a few times a week  to see if it will work better that way and I don't build up a tolerance again. I do not want to end up on high doses of this addictive med.

TeenDoctor,2/13/2015 13:57,(13-18),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,3,5,17,I had to take 35mg of Adderall in the morning before school  and then 5mg when i got home so it would last me until i went to sleep... But ive noticed that after the Adderall wears off  i would get very aggravated and i would get frustrated quickly and also i would have panic attacks and body tremors due to them wearing off.
teen,2/4/2015 21:40,(13-18),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,9,Adderall is definitely very helpful when I need to get something done. I do get a very dry mouth and sometimes it causes me to focus on the wrong things.
changedman,1/30/2015 23:13,(55-64),Male,Patient,10 years or more,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,3,14,I could not believe that feeling of being able to concentrate could boost my self-esteem. My anxiety level has increased to some degree but but the pros out weight the cons. Ive been on this medicine for 12 years and developed a tolerance which  I now do not take everyday. It doesnt work the same for me as once in the beginning but it does helps my behavior. hopefully they can come out with a better type of Adderall. I get no side effects and no dependecy.

I have been taking this for about 3 months at 5mg twice a day.  I haven't had a chance to check in with my physician  but the mess seem hit or miss.  When it works  I really feel I can actually be productive and successful. I wonder if when I talk to my doctor if we will look at other mess or increase my dosage.
Lagunagrl,1/3/2015 18:56,(55-64),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,3,5,My question for other reviewers is how extensive was the testing before you were diagnosed with ADHD? This is for adults in particular. My prescribing psychiatrist gave me a short list of statements to rate (maybe six to eight) and on that alone she prescribed what to me is a powerful drug. It's not as if she's an expert in this field. I'm beginning to think she's not a very good psychiatrists. Thoughts? Thanks.
me too,12/28/2014 0:07,(35-44),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,22,"This was a miracle drug for me. Before I started taking it  I was pretty much at wit's end. Finally was diagnosed with ADHD  after going through dozens of doctors. Immediately  it changed my world. 
I could actually focus  concentrate  and complete a task.Impossible before. I doubt I would have kept my job if I didnt start the med when I did. Pre-Adderal...anxiety  frustration  mind always going day or night  trouble having/holding conversation no concentration  constantly distracted  all making me very stressed  it was a horrible way to live. i started at 10mg twicw a day  increasing slowly over the next 4-5 mons..until now  currently at max dose of 20mg  3 times a day.My med dr actually wanted to increase to 80 mg per day  but there was an issue with insurance that was being worked out. It worked great and consistantly at each dosage  but eventually after few weeks to maybe month and half i notice my symptoms coming back. Watch for side effects- i am very active  but there was pretty quick weight loss. i think i am at 30-40 lbs lost in 4 months  im working up to 70 hrs a week  on this med 16 hr days are no prob. also i had no appetite  my mind has slowed quite a bit  i now seem to have aggressive tendecies  recently constant anger  paranoia. im like a different person. i also take with effexor  the combination was so great until recently. while it is helping in so many ways the changes have not been a problem until recently."

Kyle Wills,12/9/2014 16:03,(19-24),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,2,4,5,3,I started taking Adderall for my ADD. The doctors started me on 20mg long release capsules to start off with. The first week few weeks of taking it I noticed an increase in confidence and energy. It helped my in school tremendously. While I was taking it  I felt incredible. After the second week I began to develop a tolerance for it. I began to feel unmotivated  angry  and depressed without it. I began to crave more and more of it until I couldn't function without it. When my superscription was empty  I had to force myself to not refill it. I knew that if I continued to use it it would only make my life harder. I told my doctor that this drug is not for me. Adderall is highly addictive and I do not recommend it.

,11/22/2014 17:21,(55-64),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,3,23,I have been taking generic adderall for 3-4yrs. Like many other reviewers  I have experienced irritating jaw clenching when the drug wears off.  I have done my homework and found that with certain generic manufacturers this happens and others not.  Most pharmaceies in my area carry TEVA manufacturer (also M'ckROOT)  which I DO get clenching with this. CORE PHARMACEUTICALS is the one that I do NOT get grinding and glenching with. Find a pharmacy that can order this or can stock it.

TRB50,10/19/2014 8:55,(55-64),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,4,5,5,1,I am a Cancer patient and the medications I take to keep me free of Cancer also make me very tired. My oncologist recommended Adderall for the times when I think I may need it. For example  when I know I am going out for the night  I take 5 mg to basically stay awake and enjoy the party  dinner  show  etc.. Main problem is taking it too late (after 2pm) it's hard to fall asleep when I do get home so I found 3-5mg of Melatonin helps. I don't go out very often so 1 prescription can last for months.
barejewels,10/18/2014 19:50,(35-44),Female,Patient,10 years or more,Other,5,5,5,7,"I am ADD b4 Adderall I would put off just about everything until the last moment. My life so busy  yet never seemed to accomplish anything day in and day out.Start something then see something else needing done as I am doing the first thing I started  next thing I knew I had many things started and nothing completed. I didn't seem to ever have a lot of energy/felt tired and moody. My then doctor said I was depressed. He tried several different antidepres.(not all at once).  Nothing worked  I don't like taking pills or anything really so I wasn't taking something that had no benefit in/to me. ADD & ADHD runs on both sides of my family  I knew I was ADD guess I thought I knew how to live with it  I had this far. Long story short I ended up getting prescribed Adderall started a 5mg 3X's day ended at 20mg 3X's day  have been taking this dose for many years and has changed my life for the positive. I start & finish what I start  I don't put anything off til the last minute  I have the desire/energy to get'er done  my moodiness ""depression""-Gone. I feel like a productive adult! Now years later I drive a commercial bus; DOT Phys/Cert and Random DT'ing so Adderall has become a pain for me in this respect as DT's come back + and this new DOT Cert. Co requires I get DOT re-cert every 1yr instead of every 2yrs + proof of script to me from my phys. every year..really non-since on their part. I am sure I couldn't be a com. driver if a didn't take this script  I am a better and safer driver taking it. I would stop taking if it didn't make such a positive impact in my life. Cons"

I know I am still addicted..but have worked to take less and less.I am now on only 10mg and still on Cymbalta..It has proved to be a life saver for me..Many people have been put on the same cocktail but tend to abuse the adderral..to get the same feeling that coke gives you and that's a problem for many.I don't take these drugs to get high but to stay normal..to me it's way safer and a lot less costly"

Alex,6/20/2014 22:00,(19-24),Male,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,32,I was on Strattera for about 5 years and switching to adderall has been one of the best decisions i've made. Adderall is essentially like taking 10 red bulls. It can work for longer periods  but the biggest bonus is the quality of work that I can produce. The reason being  adderall gives me the ability to be able to be much more focused on the material and as a result  I retain it better. There is a downside however. If taken too late in the day  it can keep you awake and sometimes you can feel a bit overstimulated. Another thing to watch for may be a slight change in behaviour. I had family members that hadn't seen me in several months tell me that I seemed too stimulated during regular conversation. In terms of dosage  I personally found 20mg to be more than enough but this varies from person to person. Overall my experience has been great  it has helped me bridge that gap that has kept me from performing like the rest of the students in my classes.
Me,6/17/2014 18:43,(35-44),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Other,4,4,4,2,I was only using 10 mg for about 3 yrs. it was just enough to help me be more focused  even out my emotions and have more sustainable energy. As long as I was excersizing regularly  eating healthy and getting the sleep my body needed  I never felt I needed more than 10 mg. Once I started to slack in my healthy eating and regular excersize  I started to become more sluggish and unfocused and eventually jumped up to 15mg. I don't love how it makes me feel. After 6 months of the 15mg I felt I could use more but decided that I was not going to fall victim so once again  I have been getting back on track with my eating and excersize and have lost 5 pds  and already feel so much better. I do not crave more Adderall so by continuing good healthy habits  i'll see if I need to adjust back to 10 mg or stay on the 15 mg. I've learned that Adderall is not a substitute for unhealthy habits.

mandyslayton,6/4/2014 10:21,(35-44),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,65,"I have been taking adderall xr for almost 3 years now.
It has changed my life for the better.
I am a 35 year old female who my parents didn't believe in me taking drugs like this as a child.I knew I had issues in high school 
and I know for a fact had I been on this medication I would have done better in school
and would have cared about going to college.
I finally did something for myself when I turned 30 and went to a psychiatrist. It took a few different medications(concerta/vyvanse) before my Dr put me on Adderall. One made me so dizzy and one made my heart race. 
I can see getting addicted  but I knew with the way I live my life  I wouldn't have to worry.  
I had major issues staying focused and awake no matter how much sleep I would get. I would get bored easily or start a dozen different tasks and not get one completed. I had no time management.
I started with 20mg and I take it in the am when I wake up at 6 am. It makes me want to do my job and not get stressed. I am much more
organized. It keeps my life on track.
I started getting headaches about 3 months in and just really tired again by 3 pm. When I went to my dr for a check up she decided to
try a half of a 20mg of plain adderall at 2pm.
It did the trick and I've been on this combination ever since and haven't had to change anything.
I go to bed by 10"

AdderallForADHD,4/22/2014 10:17,(13-18),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,2,22,I gave this medication a 2 out of 5 for Ease of Use because I have had a few issues with dosage size and perscription. When I lost a significant amount of weight (due to health changes - NOT the medication)  my Dr. thought it might be best to alter my medication system  and for the next year my dose and brand was shuffled around  as a result every pharmacist in town thinks I am some cartel drug dealer. But once on the right dose for your body  Adderall is incredible for those with Attention Deficit. It will not cause shakiness or nervousness. It will have a calming effect while in your system. I can generally think much more clearly and am able to multi-task. If you need Adderall  it will work for you and you will NOT have the same reaction to it as someone taking speed. The medication for someone with ADHD will slow you  in a sense

gratefullyfocused,4/5/2014 23:37,(45-54),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,5,I am a 54 year old male. I did not put two and two together when ADHD first came to light. It did not take long to realize the connection between ADHD and my younger days. I new years ago when ADHD was medically proven and legitimized (for lack of a better description) that it was my problem. I had learned to deal with it by working harder and longer than others would have to for the same results. I would accomplish what I needed to but where others would do it in an 8 hour work day  I would take it home and spend another 2 to 3 hours to accomplish the same amount of work to have it available at the same time as everyone else. A typical 8 hour day for anyone else was a 10 to 12 hour day for me. (this also helped me understand as an intelligent person the struggles in high school). This system worked for me as I progressed in my career until my latest and highest level management position. It didn't take long for me to realize I had progressed professionally beyond my ability to overcome my focus problems using the system that had gotten me by to this point to overcome the issue. The difference after Adderall has been profound  I have no doubt that had I not discussed the problem with my doctor and began taking Adderall I would have lost the position I now hold. This is coming from someone who at 54 years old was on no prescription medication for anything and proud of that accomplishment.

Took 10mg for about 2 years during the time I wasn't aware what it was what it was supposed to be doing or feel like  it was never explained to me. Then they asked if its working or any side effects after about 2 years I don't know Im just a kid Im thinking about cartoons and stuff and I didnt really take interest or have the knowledge that I was hopped up on speed 24/7 I didnt know because I thought it was how ""normal"" feels so they upped it to 20mg. Around that time I was like a little tweeker rollin all the time  mind going 1000 mph irritability insomnia just plain weird feelings thoughts and emotions I guess the onset of amphetamine psychosis. Then in about middle school I started taking 30mg no one even the doctor was sure it was what we should do just give me an ounce of crystal meth why dont ya. I suppose around that time I became aware of its effects long before then I was completely addicted started snorting it selling empty capsules to buy more by high school I was going through at least 70 mg a day. All of this for a little a.d.d that I could manage without the stimulant especially when I discovered smoking cannabis/weed completely got rid of every negative ailment caused by this despicable byproduct of some money hungry bigot out to make a buck on peoples suffering almost completely rid of my a.d.d and made me feel completely normal again. I wanted to quit I had really bad tick it could have been from the other meds to counter act the side effects of other meds side effects caused by other meds and it was the most annoying thing. Everything in me said quit this s#! but an addict for 11 years yea right. once i turned 18 i smoked weed everyday quit the crap and live a wonderful life thanks to nature."

adderall593,3/17/2014 0:18,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,5,1,34,Please practice extreme caution when using this drug.  The first time I used it I became hooked and went to the doctor to get a prescription right away.  It was not long after that I developed a dependence that turned into an addiction  and an inability to do anything while off of the drug.  I started at 20 mg  and three years later  have to take 40-60mg to get the same effects  but the side effects are completely dreadful....intense mood swings  depression  insomnia  etc.  I just did not feel like myself  but it was still so hard to stop taking the drug.  I still take it once in a while because I have a rigorous class schedule and studying without it is almost impossible.  I am definitely a different person when I'm on it and feel that it has brought more negative than positive experiences into my life. Although not all people will have negative experiences and/or become addicted  this drug can ruin your life.

If you or a person you know has ever had bad or severe headaches previously  tell your healthcare provider before taking Adderall.
,3/9/2014 5:37,(25-34),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,15,Adderall has made my life much easier to handle  as I am able to focus on what needs to be done and not do everything at once.  Medicaid requires Brand Name Adderall  and this is more expensive than generic.  Also  pharmacies have not been able to obtain this drug  since it is so highly scheduled by the DEA!  This is ridiculous  and because people abuse this medication  I have to now pay money that I don't have  for the Adderall.  It should not be required by Medicaid to have brand name and also records from before the age of 12.  Im 27  so this is impossible for me to obtain records from 15 years ago when I was diagnosed with ADHD.  The technology back then was not as it is now with the record keeping and DEA regulations.  I don't know what to do here.

I now have so many answers to WHY I have behaved like I have ALL MY LIFE. My first episodes were in 4th grade. At 50+ years young I had no idea that I was ""not normal"". BUT it's ok. There were some adjustments that I had to make for the first couple months  but I trust my Doc. and after 14+ months of taking Amph salts I have discovered and accepted so many life changing traits/behaviors. Don't expect everyone to understand...you have to be here to know or be very trained as is my doctor. Many pharmacy personnel here in Florida have been very rude and upsetting when I fill my script every month. Mom and Pop type pharmacies have treated me very well  like they should! Listen to me  I have been to 15 to 18 PHARMACIES IN ONE DAY AT THE WALGREENS/TARGETS/CVS GOING HOME WITH NOTHING! I understand that inventories run out but the above mentioned pharmacies made me feel like a criminal 75% of the time. Please give your local Mom and Pops a chance  they are honestly hungry to serve you  NOT LIKE THE BIG CHAINS. Too bad I did not grow up around great doctors back in Oklahoma(my guess is great doctors don't want to live in dirty  ugly Okieville;sorry but it's true)  I could have had a second bite at life's apple years earlier by growing up around understanding doctors. I now recognize reasons for past failures/behaviors and can see what to change. Adderrall is not a cure just an equalizer and when without it the old actions/behaviors return. Man I had a rough start by my situation being born but it's ok. Don't believe most everyone that says you are LAZY OR CRAZY...IT'S NOT TRUE. I just didn't know I that I was lacking attention. Thank you and God Bless you all."

I have just a few left before I see my doctor again so I might try to take it like I am supposed to and see if there is a change with my ADHD. I drive myself and others crazy with my thoughts flying off the wall. When I stop taking it on the weekends I get very depressed.

I take 5 mg in the morning and 5 mg at 1 pm and it really helps me get through my day without having to lie down all the time like I used to do. My depression gets better in the spring so I'm hoping to be able to get off of the drug for spring/summer. I know it's addictive but have 3 kids and have to function; I was at my wit's end. I take other meds for depression and sleep.

,12/10/2013 13:44,(25-34),Male,Caregiver,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,37,If you truly need this medication and are on the correct dosage  it will not cause shakiness or nervousness. It will have a calming effect while in your system. You will think more clearly and be able to multi-task. I've seen comments saying this is no different than meth or crack. That is inaccurate. If you need Adderall  it will work for you and you DO NOT have the same reaction to it as someone taking speed. If you feel this way and have been diagnosed with ADHD your dose maybe too high or you might be a good candidate for the XR version. My husband's metabolism is too fast for extended release. He takes two doses a day to keep his level stable. This medication actually slows him in a sense. He is still very active but can focus and accomplish tasks effectively.

,12/4/2013 14:16,(55-64),,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,33,My doctor treated me with the usual anti-depressants - Prozac  Paxil  Lexapro  Klonopin  etc for depression  confusion  lack of self worth  crying.  Finally  my Pain Management doctor  who maintains my drug infusion pump gave me a prescription for Adderall XR.  I immediately noticed an improvement in my mental state.  I had more energy  felt more stable  better concentration  even more able to deal with my chronic pain.  I started on 10 Mg daily and increased over time.  I am now on 40 mg XR daily.  I am certain that I could use another increase  but I prefer stay as low as possible for as long as possible.  I will say that this has been the absolute best medication I have ever been on and the only one that dealt effectively with my depression.  I have never been able to deal with life in such a positive  focused  and calm manner.  I hope I never have to stop taking this medication.  Even my Psychiatrist has noticed the difference in me and he recommends that I continue on this medication.  He said he is willing to prescribe it for me if there should ever be a reason I stop requiring the services of the doctor who prescribes it for me now.  I have been under treatment with the same psychiatrist for 12 years and he agrees that this medicine has been the best prescription for improving my depression and dealing with other very complicated issues in my life.  So  for right now  he says continue the good work and he is very pleased that I have found the correct medication. Over the course of therapy  I have gone from 6 different medications a day down to 2.  I also still take .05 Klonopin at night  if necessary  for anxiety.  I am happy to say that I have never felt better.  I do realize this is an addictive drug  however  it is also a necessary drug for some people and I am one of them.
,12/2/2013 20:30,(19-24),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,5,2,7,Began taking 20mg three times a day 2 1/2 years ago. I am 23 and have been off medication for 5 months. Adderall at this dosage increased my heart rate  decreased my appetite  and increased focus. Tasks in school were easy  studying was efficient and listening was second nature. Difficulties lied with eating. In order for me to enjoy a meal  I would need to stay off the med for at least 2 days. After being off the drug for 5 months  I have had better success in  school (no failing grades) and better appetite. However  social skills became worse  reading became difficult  getting a firm grasp of ideas became non existent  confidence decreased  sex drive decreased and wellness decreased. While the benefits outweigh the negatives  the moral aspect of the medication became important. Therefore after serious thought  some kind of ADD med should be taken. This could be a mixture of adderall (for stimulation) with strattera to fill in the gaps.

I am on the lowest dose you can get  5 mg  and I take it as needed only because it tends to cause some stomach issues such as upper abdominal pain  painful gas  and slight nausea.. But.. This drug has helped me to focus  complete household tasks  I find myself felling happy on it and I don't need a nap.. I usually split my 5 mg into halves and take in morning and afternoon...if it didn't upset my stomach I would take it more often..amazing medication!

He had noticed  during my sessions with him that I would jump from on subject to another  and never really finish discussing one issue before skipping to something I needed to talk about. He asked me if I had ever been tested for ADHD and I said  ""No  but years earlier another doctor thought I should  but I just really didn't understand what could be done to help me focus; and truly thought that there's no way a medicine could help me stay focused on one task at a time. Since several years had passed by now  I decided to take the ADHD assessment test  and the results were that I'm ADHD  and that's when he started me on the Adderall 10mg twice daily  but the ended up raising the dosage to 20mg twice daily. I notice a complete difference in my ability to pay attention and to complete a task at work instead of having so many different things going on at once  but not following through well with any of the. I am much more calm;not figity.  It has helped my work performance and personal relationships."

About a year ago  I noticed that I was having mild to moderate facial ticks (rapid blinking  nose tick gestures)  etc.  I have know for many years that I have a very mild case of Tourette's Syndrome  but for some reason  the Adderall seems to have brought out those symptoms after two years  and not sure why this is happening.  When taking Adderall  I feel normal  active  hopeful and at my full potential -- and I have incredible focus at work.  When I don't take Adderall  I feel just the opposite; lethargic  depressed  and kind of generally overwhelmed with life.  My question is this  has any one else out there that also has Tourette's Syndrome  found a good remedy for this.  A combination drug with Adderall?  A smaller dosage of Adderall?  Currently  I take a 30mg generic  and it is called ""Amphetamine Salts ER 30 mg Cap""  manufactured by Teva/Barr.  I really hate to quit taking this  but near the end of the half life of the dose  the tourrette's syndrome symptoms are getting to the point where it is almost not worth taking.

,11/8/2013 1:01,(25-34),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Other,1,4,4,3,"Adderall worked great for the first year I was on it  then it turned on me.  This is a serious medication with serious side effects   I am shocked and disgusted that any parent would put a young child on such a strong drug for their ""ADD.""  I began with 20mg a day and had amazing grades while working full time as a bartender  I honestly felt like every time I popped one of these I got a little ""high"" from it and euphoric.  It made me impulsive  impatient  obsessive compulsive  and sometimes anti-social.  I wasn't aware how much this drug changed my personality until the third year I was on it.  I was fully addicted taking only 30 mg at the most in a day  but when the pills went on back order I realized how bad withdrawal sucked from it.  I couldn't leave my bed or do the simplest tasks without popping an adderall for the day.  I also became paranoid  and sometimes would hear things that weren't there  that's when I knew this drug was messing my head up.  I quit taking adderall and it took a good 6 months for me to regain my natural energy. I'm back to my normal  social  happy self.  I think adderall causes serious problems with your body  as I had heart palpitations  poor circulation  weight loss  chest pains  extreme insomnia  and mental instability while on this drug.

I'm now off the medication now from having ER visits this year. I was having (what appeared) to be heart issues  maybe a seizure. Un-fortunately tests didn't find anything wrong  nor finding the exact cause.
But one identified issue was less sexual interest  EDD.
Hospital bills and other medical costs were escalating  I was once quite healthy  now these issues. My marriage means a lot  so I'm dealing with ADD without medication  and feeling better as a result- and no more EDD.

So once your body gets adjusted to it and you have no history heart disease in the family or high blood pressure this drug(like me with ADD)Will do wonder's. Do not listen to other people's experiences. Especially DO NOT Search the web for chat rooms talking nonsense jibberish about the drug. If you pay attention to the chat rooms on other people's opinions  you will commit suicide with all the crapola you will hear. Take the recommended dose from your doctor.

However  I did not take Adderall until I was 19 years old & it was the right ADD medicine for me. I had tried Concerta during high school & it made me like a zombie. That didn't mean I didn't have ADD/ADHD it just meant I was on the wrong medication. It can be vice versa for other people but my best advice I can give for finding the right ADD medication is you have found the right one if you still feel like yourself. If you are overly hyper or overly inactive  I highly recommend trying a different medication until you find one that you can't tell a big difference in your personality  but makes a big difference in your day.

However  it has altered my personality and I am very easily angered. The dry mouth  altough less severe  painful and inconvenient. So  if reviewing the effecitveness of the drug's intended purpose  it works very well. Overall  I still give it a thumbs-up  but I have suffered socially. Especially the false sense of well-being. I will continue to take this  though.

I was diagnosed with depression 14 years ago and was prescribed Paxil. After six months of little change in my condition  I was prescribed Prozac and Xanax. Over the next few years  my conditioned worsened. I was eventually prescribed Ambien for insomnia  which was a huge mistake.

I became addicted to Ambien  not for the sleep benefits but for the Utopian feeling it provided me. I would take it several times during the day  and quickly began running out of my prescriptions. This led to ""Doc Shopping "" and eventually I had three doctors writing me scripts every month.

I have lived with ADD since as far back as I can remember.Being a child of the fifties I was labeled as some body not paying attention to studies just a lazy kid with mediocre grades through out high school. When I went to college the steep curb was too much for me to handle so I started to fail in math and sciences.That brought over a major depression and a sence failure in life besides a lot of efforts from the age of 18 till I was about 55 years old.No body believed me when I said I was having problems absorbing class lectures and studies  they all thought I just did not try hard enough. At age 55 on my suggestion my doctor prescribed me Adderol 20 mg  vow a heavy fog was lifted out of my brain and I can feel the world around me much clearer. I wish all those specailist had diagnosed me sooner so I did not have to put all the missery and disoppintments. I am taking low dosage of this medication thats keep me going to perform my job much better than before. I still have my low moments but they are not very frequent. By the way I was not hyper active kid just distracted kid.

So I decided to go take a chance I couldn't get out of bed couldn't remember anything...I suggest if you start off to break the pills in fours if you start on 10's and put a little in your system at a time  because you will need to have more and more because it does wear off...I am with one lady if you have a problem then this medicine is a life saver  but if you taking it for a high  it is highly addictive. I don't even have to take mine everyday just on days when I need to get up and get out of bed. I have MS  and this medicine works..Only side effect is that I itch internally like I wanna scratch my liver or kidney and I can't...lol.. try it for yourself everyone is different.

I am now on my second round with low dose therapy Adderall as a central nervous system stimulant to counter the severe fatigue.  The first round ended 2 1/2 yrs ago and it worked great. I took 20mg in the morning and 20mg in the afternoon with very few side effects.  The side effects that I did notice were my blood pressure was on the higher end of 120/80 and my appetite was decreased (not that this is a bad thing).  I have just started back on the therapy again.  I am hoping that it works as well this time.

Cass,5/31/2013 7:40,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,4,5,17,I took adderall for a very long time. 40 mgs XR a day  30 mgs in the morning and 10 at night. It works  however I wouldn't suggest it go to just anyone.. Adderall has a severe side effect which happens to almost everyone who takes it. Not eating  its not that you don't want to eat but that your just not hungry  you feel full. Put it like this I'm 21 years old and was about 130 pounds  perfect weight when I took adderall my weight fluctuates alot  I'm not 115. I actually force myself to eat because with adderall you won't eat for days  literally. My sister who is 26 years old and slightly overweight took adderall and lost about 100 pounds in just a 2 months. She looked fantastic  however thats just not healthy. Now my sisters pregnant and she gained all that weight back plus baby weight. Although  it does what its suppose to do you make a choice  Do you want to get rid of a problem to gain another problem? Your decision!

,5/21/2013 11:20,(25-34),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,14,Before taking Adderall  my thoughts were not organized and if I didn't write something down  I was not going to remember it. Since beginning it  my family and friends have noticed the organization in my thoughts and reasoning skills. As a college student  I had never had a teacher compliment my organization in a paper until I was medicated; I was so excited to see the comment on a paper I called my parents and nearly cried! Unfortunately I think I need to up my prescription as I am finding my mind wandering more throughout the day  but I am still anxious by the end of the day. I don't know what I would do without Adderall  but I just hope it continues helping like it did in the beginning!

I also have some difficulty with not sleeping  especially if I take it later in the day.  I do have a tendency to manipulate that though so I can stay up and work on big projects.

No issues with sleep...but  very easy to abuse...if I needed to get something done  could take late in the day and stay up all night. Advantageous at times but I got out of that mode very quick. Then about 3 weeks  it just quit working. I am tired most of the time and if I try to watch a video that I am interested in  about 15 minutes and I have to go do something else. So this week we will shift to something different....but  it worked great for a long time. I was taking 60mg every morning....

MollyGordy,5/5/2013 22:16,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,12,I was having trouble organizing my thoughts and tasks. I would start one thing then stop that and start something else....finishing neither task. I became very fidgety and also lethargic as well. My thought process was chaotic. My husband had passed away in January of 2013 and along with the grief from my loss  I also experienced deeper depression. There were things I wanted to do and things I NEEDED to do and just couldn't muster up the energy to do anything. There were many days that I didn't feel like getting dressed  washing up  brushing my teeth or even leaving the house. I also had the added task of finding a job. I remained unemployed during the time of my husband's sickness until his death-about 10 months. I couldn't even MAKE myself do anything! And that was depressing in itself. My doctor tried me on Adderall and it was a godsend! I was up and showered and dressed every morning  got caught up on housework  began the job hunt and became more social. I hope she never takes me off of it!

It worked wonders of my focus is school and controlled my hyperactivity really well for the most part  but the side effects were just too much. Heart palpitations  no appetite whatsoever and nausea  but the worst by far was the anxiety. I would have four or five panic attacks a week just from tiny things like homework  and it drove me crazy. I ended up switching medications a couple months ago  and I'm doing much better now. These meds work great but DO NOT take them if you have a fast heart rate to begin with or are already prone to worrying/anxiety.
Onslo,4/8/2013 8:24,(45-54),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,35,Wonder drug ! I wish I had it when I was in school. I was labeled as a problem kid. Lazy   always  in trouble. In the remedial classes in most subjects. Could not pay attention to things that were not interesting to me. Age 44 is when I was given my first dose of adderall. My kids were taking it for ADD. My doctor was treating me with anti depressants with no real results. He gave me a simple test to take in his office. Switched me to adderall to see if things in my life improved. With in just a few days I noticed Hugh improvements in my life. I was able to do things that I could never do before. Like understanding what I had just read  being able to focus on things that were always a challenge to me so I avoided them. I could understand new concepts and enjoyed learning for the first time in my life. Before I struggled with following basic instructions and would get frustrated and just give up.  For me it was a new life that I could enjoy and be present and be part of things I was scared to get involved in. For fear that others would think I was slow or challenged. Adderall change my whole life for the better. I wonder where I would be today if I had been given this drug in my early school years. I own a very successfully catering business and I'm happy with my life. I will always wonder what I could have accomplished if I was given the right treatment when I was in school.

It has not caused me to have weight loss  infact I have gained & maintain with difficulty to loose weight.  I sleep well when I do sleep & it is just such a miracle drug for me.  I notice when I have taken vacations from it   I can not think for myself & I can NOT stay still long enough  when trying to sit at my desk to get work done.   I am very concerned about the ability to get COMPLETELY off this drug & function as I should.  Haven't got that far yet but will surely let you know when or if I do.   Important need of Adderral for me is that is slows me down MENTALLY so that I can properly function & think as I should in orders to focus & concentrate on very important & large amounts of work.  I was told by my doctor I was a TRUE canidate for this drug & I must agree.  I have Never been on any medication in my life.  This is the first & I am 51 years old."

catelyn,3/22/2013 8:51,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,11,"My doctor put me on this medication about a year and a half ago. In the beginning it had improved my attention span majorly  and I was able to concentrate for much longer periods of time without letting my thoughts distract me. I started noticing that after taking it for awhile it was not working as well as it did at first because I was becoming more tolerant to it  this meant I had to increase my dose. I try to give myself a ""medication vacation"" at least one day a week  usually a lazy day  but i noticed now when i dont take it  I literally cannot function well at all  all I want to do is lay in bed all day. This medication has also caused me to lose over 50 pounds in about 10 months because my appetite decreased so much from it. Now I am down to about 105 pounds and I am a 23 year old female about 5'5""  so this is defintely not a healthy weight for me. So I would say this medication definitely has its pros and cons. I guess it depends on the person."

I am much more focused  and able to concentrate on what people are saying.  In addition to intellectual improvement  it has improved my atheletic performances!!  It allows me to better concentrate and assimulate what the coaches are saying to me.  Then  while I am doing an atheletic activity  I am better able to concentrate on what I am doing without my mind wondering.  

Also  I seem to be much better at focusing on multiple body parts at the same time.  It use to be that if I focused on what my arms were doing  I would skrew up with my legs and vice-versa.  Now I seem to be able to think about what I am doing with my arms  legs  shoulders etc etc all at the same time.  I feel so much better coordinated."

I have been on this regimen of it for 4 months and my doctor said he will probably titrate me up to the XR-20's when i get my next prescription because I have been taking 2 IR'S pretty much every day because the XR-15 only lasts about 5 hours for me. That is my only complaint with this drug  is that currently I have to take different forms  multiple times per day and that's annoying. The other side effect I experience greatly is decreased appetite because it is about 60 percent generic dexedrine in the XR's

head injury,2/20/2013 15:50,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,5,5,5,Taking Adderall (generic)10mg 2st month and 20 mg 2nd month I begain losing my hair and my eyelashes were falling out (quite noticeable).  I stopped using it for a a couple of months (in between used ritalin [generic not as effective with focus and concentration] and my eyelashes grew back and my hair was not back to where it was before I started taking aderall but it stopped thinning  I was having nightmares and evil dreams  my eyes were so dried that I would wake up in pain in the middle of the night and have to put eye drops in  constipation  and racing thoughts.  I started taking the NAME BRAND Adderall a few months afterwards because I thought maybe the side effects were from the fillers because I am very sensitive to some medications.  I was able to concentrate and focus and become a normal person but again  slowly but surely  my eyelashes started to fall out and my eyes were dry but not as bad as on the generic brand--the dry eyes I could have tolerated  but I had to stop the Adderall or lose my hair on my head and eyelashes. Aside from the hair loss  I would have stayed on the NAME BRAND Adderall.  It was like I had chemotherapy and my hair was falling out.
,2/14/2013 18:21,(25-34),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,19,While I was initially skeptical of taking this medication because of my professional life (I'm an active-duty commissioned officer in the United States Air Force) I must admit that this mdication has changed my life. Not only was this medication life-changing  it only took hours for me to realize the bennifits of the treatment in terms of subsidence of my ADHD symptoms. While others have experienced problems with Adderall and its generic forms  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND anyone suffering with serious  life-altering ADHD symptoms (as I was) consult your primary care physican or mental health care provider and see if this is an option for you. Believe me  I understand the challenges associated with both the stigma associated with ADHD generally and this medication specifically  but I promise that if this treatment is as effective for you as it was for me you'll kick yourself for waiting so long to try it (just like I did)!

wowqt06,2/9/2013 15:53,(25-34),Female,Patient,10 years or more,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,14,My doctors previously have tried me on non stimulating medications. But with Adderall I've always come back to. Why? Because it works! I am now on 60mg a day. I have found that I am able to do menial tasks like housework  stay on task for helping my 11yo with homework  stay on task for craft projects and am able to keep a cool head when amongst stressful situations. Also I am playing darts in leauge and when it comes to state darts or any tournament  you can tell when I am have not taken my dose properly. I do need however my iPod when playing as well. I do not have an appetite and do sometimes stress eat  but I have been able to take better control my eating. With Adderall I have been able to take back my life  instead of this condition take control of me. I reccomend this medication for anyone who cannot find the right med for them. What's the  worst that will happen? It won't work? Oh well try try try again! Hope this was helpful to someone.
soo grateful for Adderall,2/4/2013 14:03,(35-44),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,8,WOW miracle drug  did not realize I had ADD went to doctor about anxiety  he asked me about my kids and wanted me to try this. Life changing for me! I allows me to focus on my paper work  greatly improves my attitude towards work (I used to procrastinate to the extreme)  solved my anxiety (I feel it drew a curtain in my mind between tasks constantly thinking about and what I am doing at the moment)  I used to think about sex all the time (it solved that I only think about it when I am in bed with wife but don't feel it has to happen)  I feel my poor memory has improved slightly and focus is awesome. I love this drug and appreciate what it has done for me....made me more normal and competent. thanks you much

cyvexis@gmail.com,1/28/2013 17:21,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,26,"I was raised in a verbal  physical  sexual abused drug & alcohol addicted environment. My depression started at an early age. I had my first child on my 18th birthday & my second 18 months later. I had cervical cancer & had a partial hysterectomy @ age 26. In 2003 @ the age of 15 my only son was killed in a horrific alcohol related auto accident. My brother was the driver. 
I lost interest in everything.I lost everything.I cut myself off from even my best friend. I turned to drugs & alcohol(which I swore to NEVER do after the life I endured)for about 3 yrs. YES I wanted to die  but never once thought of suicide. One day I just decided I had enough & quit all the nonsense. I did not seek help until 7 yrs after his death. I am now 43. Since I was a teen I noticed I had problems concentrating  seeing things through to the end  lack of interest. Daily headaches  some leading to migraine. Multiple projects going at once. Occasional panic attacks & anxiety. I am so O.C.D. about certain things that I get on my own nerves. The panic attacks & anxiety have progressed over the years so I take xanax as well.  After trying several anti depressants that NEVER worked. & after seeing the results my daughter had with the Adderall  I asked to try it. It has made such a difference in my life. I can actually concentrate long enough to complete what I start. I have found my passion for my art again. All this time & All the different medications I have tried  people tell me it is a miracle cure for me & can attest to the fact that I feel like a NORMAL human being for once in my life..........I am extremely scared to death of this medication though.... I NEVER want to go back to whoever I was before Adderal Yet I don't want to become dependant on it & have to take it forever....rock & a hard place on this one...It is only thing I have found that actually works yet the aspect of the methamphetamine scares me."

I do have to say of all the medications I have taken for ADHD it deifinitely works the best. I have no jumpiness or anxiety from it and no crash either which i got all of from concerta and focalin. the biggest concern is that it gives me fairly bad headaches and i know it can raise blood pressure
TMS,1/25/2013 8:55,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,3,4,4,6,This medication definately works and I have noticed a difference   especially when at work. Only issue is that it does become less effective the longer you take it. So like alot of people have suggested it may be a good idea to take a few days off from taking the medication. I also have experience slight headaches and hands and feet feeling cold. I am not sure if or how it would effect circulation but since taking I have experienced these side effects. Overall  I am happy I spoke up to my doctor and was honoest on how I was feeling because since taking adderall I have felt more like myself.

She has become a 95lb. weakling and I am very afraid for her life  she was once a 135 lb. healthy woman and is wasting away to nothing. This med. is not for everyone and I feel our medical professionals are despensing this medication too freely. Be very aware of what you are taking  because your Doctors DO NOT CARE!!!!

I was also so envious of people and embarrassed of myself. I turned 40 and was just sick of struggling with fatigue  and not completing tasks and before I knew it I had alot of unfinished things to do. This made my symtoms even more difficult...i didnt feel normal. i took the written test and realized that i wasnt a mess  and this can be addressed and would not have to struggle anymore. My doctor and I tested it out and i seen immediate results. we adjusted it alittle until I was at the perfect dose for me and my lifestyle. I feel normal.... its been along time waiting!
KittyCat,12/24/2012 14:16,(45-54),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5,5,4,11,"I was treated for major depression and anxiety disorders for many years  with ADHD being a secondary diagnosis.  My Psychiatrist turned things around out of lack of any more ideas  and treated my ADHD as my primary diagnosis.
The results have been amazing.  Adderall stops the anxiety and panic attacks completely.  Unfortunately  it's a very short-acting medication with me  so I only get 3 hours of relief from it.  Those 3 hours are worth it  just to be able to breathe after many years of constant anxiety.
ADHD makes it difficult for me to finish any tasks  clean my house  or take care of pressing paperwork. All of this leads to extreme anxiety  then depression.  By treating the ADHD first  I am able to focus more  get some things done  and the anxiety and depression over it all lessens.  
Dependence is definitely an issue... you must be careful to take it only as directed.  I take it every other day or so  when I need to focus  and trying not to become dependent. When I do take it every day  I can feel myself needing it more often  as the anxiety gets worse.
It's not perfect  but I finally have some relief from depression and anxiety after 20 years."

I am a nurse and I am required to multitask. This medication helps me do that. Without the pills I tend to procrastinate a lot which is bad for my job as well.

If I don't take it in the morning I can tell because I am more lethargic  ditzy  and spaced out. It helps me not think about food constantly too. 

The only side effects is that if I get busy and don't take in enough water it will make my lips chap up really bad and get red. I do hate having to pick up a actual script each month and pay about 30 dollars for the XR capsules. The tablets don't seem to last as long and I can never remember to take my afternooon dose. I prefer the 20 mg XR in the AM instead of 20 IR in the AM and 10 IR in the afternoon.

 I have a script for 10 IR in the afternoon in addition to the 20 XR in the morning but I feel like that it is too much and I have a hard time winding down in the evening."

He however is and has NEVER been hyper  just no attention span. This medication has been a blessing! He remembers what he has been taught  and is so much happier  it brought me to tears! He is excelling at school and home. So glad we tried this.
kris,11/19/2012 11:44,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,20,Before getting diagnosed and taking medication  my life was difficult and stressful.  I'm in graduate school and ever since I was younger I always had to study 2-4 times harder than everyone else just to get the same grade.  I was constantly losing everything  forgetting what I had been doing  and forgetting important things/events.  Now I've been taking a generic adderall and my life is so much easier.  I have spent less time studying and am finally able to organize things without getting distracted every 5 min.  Adderall is not good for everyone with ADHD and different treatments are available.  After my experience on medication  I would recommend that people with ADHD at least try some sort of medication.  All of my friends who have ADD/ADHD take medication and are just fine.  There are some side effects  but those are generally mild and go away after some time.  All in all  adderall has helped me a lot in graduate school  and I don't think I would be able to finish without it.
Mjenn,11/17/2012 17:51,(19-24),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,5,5,5,6,My friend suggest i try one of her adderalls  And it was sooo great! doctor put me on Zoloft for depression  i do not like it at all! i get a headache from it and i dont even want to take it anymore. I want to get put on Adderall but since the doctor diagnosed me with depression how do i tell her i think i might just have ADD instead.
ps,11/14/2012 20:34,(55-64),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,20,"I was prescribed Adderall three years ago and it has helped a great deal.  It helped alleviate probems such as chronic generalized anxiety panic attacks and bouts of depression (all disorders that physicians had been trying to ease with various prescriptions for years).  With Adderall  I find myself simply pushing past the anxiety and panic. I have always been a perfectionist and this med does lend to occasional OCD  but so far  this has been managable.
I have also had insomnia since I was a child and presently take Seroquel at bedtime so that I'm able to sleep. Prescribed sleeping pills have not worked. Since Seroquel is known for weight gain  I have not enjoyed the weight loss I have heard others on Adderall describe.  I have recently tried Valerian Root and Melotonin with some positive results. Any other suggestions? Overall  Adderall has been a lifesaver - the positive effects far outnumber the negative ones."

rebecca,11/10/2012 10:20,(45-54),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,9,it is great to be able to focus and concentrate without forgetting or moving onto something else before i finished .
rewindmind,11/8/2012 10:02,(45-54),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,28,"Adderall has helped me focus and actually complete a task or a 'to do' list. Can't believe what a difference it makes. My husband used to 'poo-poo' me...you are lazy  just focus  why can't you get anything done? I thought I was losing my mind. Was tested for ADD/ADHD by a psychiatric doctor who said I was anxious and depressed and prescribed Xanax....that made me sleepy and more disconnected. 

Finally found a nurse practitioner who recognized my symptoms right away. Sitting in her office  I couldn't even keep my feet/legs still....always felt as if I needed to be doing something!! Within three days  I couldn't believe the difference. I can focus at work  I can listen to a conversation without having my mind race at all the 'things' I need to complete. Just wish I would have had this in college...a lot of my professors thought I was just a scatterbrain...
One of the best commercials on TV was my ah-ha moment. A woman is sitting in a conference room--in a meeting with many others. The camera focuses on her face and she has thoughts racing through her mind  the announcer says...""her mind is like a television that can't find the right channel"" shows constantly changing channels/commercials...Oh my...that is me...!! I knew I needed to find someone to help me. If this sounds like you...search until you find a health care provider that will listen. The first doc I saw  made me think there was something seriously wrong with me  even after all the ADHD tests. The Nurse Practitioner diagnosed me at the first visit. 
I have no issues with this medication  no shaking or nervousness...the opposite effect actually. One complaint  it is amphetamine  salts...there is a 'salty' taste in my mouth--occasionally. I drink lots of water during the day  that seems to help."

I went from a social reject to having a lot of friends  and I no longer constantly struggle with being exhausted during the day. Tolerance will build  however  so use it sparingly.

LaineyJane,10/15/2012 18:10,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,2,17,Adderall for me was an instant result  my mind was never so calm I didn't have frantic fragment thoughts  little reminders  Idea  lists  (constant lists) of things I needed to get to do with so little time  I was always running late  my mind constantly racing franticly how to get all these things done as quickly and as efficiently as possible.  There was always so little time! Now Keep in mind I was aware I had ADD and ADHD for many years prior to making the decision to try medications. I strongly believe in mind over matter  and over the years I learned how to function and get things done  completed school  however everything seemed to take me soooo much longer  I worked so HARD to get the grades I got but was I was determined. With out medication I was Anxious all the time I was all stressed about what needed to be done but  but never felt like I was getting anything anywhere. I didn't understand everyone had the same 24 hours in a day  racing thoughts kept me up at night  I felt like I was spinning out of control! The first day I took Adderall it had never felt more calm and quite in my head I am sleeping better  I feel less anxious it has been wonderful in that aspect but like all drugs I do struggle with the side Effects and finding a balance in my medication as well as questions with stimulants and conception/ pregnancy. Over all I am very grateful for this treatment I have lots of questions concerns about going off of it for pregnancy  I work FT and prior to taking meds I had learned function with my crazy abnormal pathways in my head but now with out meds will I be lost in my own head!

If I only knew,10/5/2012 3:36,(19-24),Male,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,13,As a child I never really knew that i had a short attention span. I've always had a hard time in school  but I really noticed it whenever I got into college. No matter how much I studied I couldn't seem to retain any information. About a year ago I went to my doctor and found out I have ADD. I never knew I had it until I looked back at my childhood and all the way to me now as an adult. I was put on adderall 20mg twice a day my life actually became normal. For the first time in my life I actually heard a clock ticking while talking to family. My ability to stay focused and on task was just the best feeling in the world. My life has very organized and I can hold interest in studying  my work  as well as my social life. The only downfall about adderall was that it had an extreme supression of my appetite and I had no extra weight to lose. After I would come down off of my doseage I get very irritable  not sure if it's a side effect from the drug or the fact I work 3rd shift as a police officer and rarely sleep good. But overall this has been a blessing to me and my ability to do better at work and at home. If I only had this when I was a young kid and in school I believe my grades would have been out of this world!

Up until a year ago  it helped A LOT. I suddenly got good grades  more social  and felt great about myself. This past year  I noticed it wasn't giving me the same awesome effects. So  I started taking half of one extra  for that extra boost. Half of one became 4. Yes  I was taking 7 to 8 a day. This went on for about 9 months.

I was drug tested and the results showed positive for 97% D Methamphetamine isonomer and 3% L Methamphetamine isonomer. 4872 Amphetamine and 1872 Methamphetamine. I have researched and came to the conclusion that the generic DAmphetamine Salt Combo is the causitive factor compared to the Amphetamine(Adderal). I need documentation to support to save my licensure. My employment agency has my current prescription on file stating Adderal 20mg (generic ok). Please assist. I found no clinical difference between brand and generic and the efficacy is amazing.

kissmissrabbit,8/15/2012 0:07,(19-24),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,4,5,4,7,I had been diagnosed multiple times with manic depression  anxiety  psychosis etc etc  and yet none of the medications seemed to help me overall with my mood and motivation. Then recently after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia  I was referred to a psychologist for ADD testing which can be affiliated with fibromyalgia. I was then diagnosed with ADD and was put on 10 mg of adderall twice daily. It has done absolute wonders for me. Taking it early enough in the morning and once again around noon keeps me from being up too late. My mood is always heightened and I am very motivated and not overwhelmed. The only downfall is that of a rare side effect  which would be once the adderall starts to wear off  I get the sensation of bugs crawling all over my skin. It scared me at first because my first impression was that it could be bed bugs or scabies  but after both were ruled out  I learned it is a rare and unspoken side effect of this drug  which has been controlled by a low dosage of atarax  which is an antihistamine primarily. and the nice thing about it is that it helps me sleep at night! Anyone else seem to have that bizarre sensation once it gets later in the day and the adderall is wearing off?
Donah,8/10/2012 14:32,(55-64),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,17,It makes my life run much smoother  I have to multi-task during my day and it makes it possible  Prior to getting on this medication I would have 6 projects started and could never seem to stay on any one thing long enough to finish.I have had no side effects except from time to time I get shakey hands for a short time. Its a wonder drug for me.
,8/10/2012 12:50,(19-24),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,17,I've been taking Adderall for about 8yrs now and there's good news and bad news. Good news is that it works wonderfully in managing the symptoms. The bad news is that you have to watch how your appetite is affecting your eating habits  usually you won't be hungry until the medicine wears off and you might find yourself malnourished if you're not careful. Also note that you can develop permanent 'tics' or compulsive repetitive behaviors. I have developed a tic of chewing on the side of my tongue. I am now pregnant and cannot take the medication for obvious reasons and yet I still chew on my tongue  but that being said  it isn't severe enough to prevent me from retaking it after my pregnancy because the ADHD is definitely worse than the side-effects of the Adderall. However  every person is different so maybe for other people these 'tics' and appetite changes might not seem so minor. Overall though I have found it very useful and it has made a huge and mostly positive difference in my life  so if you're thinking about trying it to treat your ADHD then I'd say go right ahead.
Stormy48,8/7/2012 0:52,(45-54),,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5,4,5,11,"I have suffered from depression for most of my adult life but the last two years I was lucky to get up dut to family drama and I had  had enough of hurting. I had no idea that I could be helped so much by a medication. I do understand it is considered an ""upper"" for those not afflicted with ADHD. I had seen the shows of abuse by parents with this medication. This medication  although  not used for ADHD  for me  allowed me to feel like I wanted to get up and live my life. I have only been on it for less than 6 months but I feel it saved my life by giving me the kick in the butt someone else might get from coffee. Nothing worked for me  complete loss of energy until I started the Adderall Oral. It is mentioned as a treatment for severe depression and I refuse to feel bad for using a medication that made me want to live again. It's not magic  I still have to think positive  not focus on the negative but I'm so thankful this medication serves more than one ailment."

During the day  I was a complete zombie. don't me wrong  it worked. I focused and did my work  but from last period to about 7 O'clock I was a complete wreck. I would get angry  and cry. I'd have MASSIVE headaches everyday and when I did my homework i'd get impatient  cry somemore and just feel hopeless. upset that I couldn't do my work like I could the rest of the day and get re-angry when someone tried to help me with it. I've given up on medication and am a firm believer that you can overcome this by yourself. Jst a strong will power and dedication to success.

I used to be so unorganized  with my manic thinking and racing thoughts and insomnia  as well as being so extremely uncomfortable in any and all social situations. Now I am able to function in daily life and have a daily routine I stick too as well; by feeling comfortable in my own skin and before having no self confidence  now I see myself as attractive and young and intelligent and full of potential. 

When put on this medication by my doctor - after being on every anti-depressant  anti-psychotic  mood stabilizers and benzodiazapines  etc; since the age of 4 and am now 29 - I now feel that I have finally found the one psychiatric drug that has actually helped me in my life. Not just with my Adult Add  but also with my Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder and Bi-Polar I Disorder and lack of concentration  focus and energy to complete tasks.

In meetings I can remember what was said  because I actually pay attention  I'm not checking my phone or drawing.  Even my coworkers have noticed that I am much more ""quiet"" (they don't know my condition).  The best part...my head is quiet.

It has really helped with my inatentiveness and I don't have the extreme highs and lows nor do I feel like crap when i dont take it like I have with other stimulant medications. The only drawback to this medication is it causes constant spotting. Ive been spotting every day since I started the medication even if I don't take it on the weekends or if I'm on vacation the spotting is still present. It's a small price to pay for a medication that ""normalizes"" your cognitive functioning."

During this time  I was treated with xanax(alprazolam) tablets which  as directed  I took 3x a.day. Over these years I was at a dose of up to 6 mg per day. I tried one time foolishly to just stop taking it and was put in the hospital the following day  unaware that I was going through serious and potentially life-threatening issues. Then  lure and behold  in 2009  the dr who I continue to see suggested that I actually seemed to be suffering from adult add. He immediately placed me on adderall. It has been a life changing med and is the sole reason that I.am now free from the addictive grip of xanax. Well  I am now almost totally off of benzos and currently working down from only a 5 mg diazepam...1/2-1 twice daily. Its so nice to be medicated appropriately and arty the same time  I am no longer a slave to anypill.

Kristy,4/29/2012 14:55,(13-18),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,19,I've been taking Adderall since I was in 3rd grade for treatment for my ADHD. I am now a junior in high school and still take it daily for school. When I started taking Adderall it was the 5mg IR before school every day. A very low dosage for an 8 year old but it did help. Since then I changed to 10 mg ER somewhere in later middle school when I was either 13 or 14. Just this year I increased to 20 mg ER before school with 10 mg IR after school in order to help focus on homework. The adderall has been invaluable for me in helping me focus both during school and out  as well as lowering my impulsivity since it gives me that second reaction time before I say something or do something I shouldnt. The only side effect Ive ever noticed is that I do have a decrease of appetite when on the pill and once it wears off Im ravenously hungry. However  once on the medication for 5 days or so that symptom has gone away and I end up hungry again. Overall I would recommend it to anyone with ADD or ADHD.

wakeupdjt,4/26/2012 6:07,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,1,5,3,9,Hypersomnia. Put on Adderall. Yes  it keeps me awake but the side affects  to me  are not worth it.  I had severe loose bowel movements  slight headaches  shakiness  VERY IRRITABLE AND ADJITATED at every little thing.  Became cold to the world and everyone in it.  Sore throat  and severe rash on my chest that still hasn't gone away after almost 2 weeks off the adderall.  I was very sensitive to anything that seemed loud....things that I normally wouldn't think was loud.  Fighting with my own mind and my family constantly.  Tightness in my thumbs  yeah WEIRD.  Sore tongue and the list goes on. Also  even though I was awake  I had absolutly NO MOTIVATION AND WOULDN'T EVEN COMPLETE A SIMPLE CHORE.  My mood has gotten better since off of this and I would never recommend it to anyone.  But I know each medication is different for everybody. Hey  if I didn't have the HORRIBLE side affects I would still take it because it did keep me from excessive sleep.  Now went to a neuropsychiatrist and he put me on Nuvigil  which I have heard GOOD AND UGLY news about  but can't even try it because my insurance won't cover it.  Now  back to the doc tomorrow to get my script for ritalin and am totally scared because the rates on that med. don't seem any better than the adderall. But  you never know it may work for me.  I can only pray. Just wanted to share my story in case any of you have had these side affects I would immediatly stop.

BreezieBoo,2/12/2012 13:14,(19-24),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,26,To begin  I've never had an issue with addiction or drug abuse. I'm a college senior with a GPA of 3.6. I LOVE my classes and professors  but I can't pay attention as well as I wished. I found myself drinking insane amounts of coffee just to try and stay focused. I couldn't get through more than 4 pages in a book without having to reread it again. The worst part was  I had absolutely no motivation to do any schoolwork away from school (which used to not be a problem at all.) So  a few weeks ago  a classmate told me she was prescribed Adderall for the last 14 years  but stopped taking it  and selling it to make a quick buck. I had already researched ADD and ADHD and self diagnosed myself. I cut a 20mg pill in half  and didn't feel any difference at all. I waited a day or 2 and tried a full 20mg dose. 30 minutes later or so  I then found myself reading normally again  I was motivated to do things I had put off for weeks  I didn't get bored doing normal everyday things  and I didn't feel like I was moving at a million miles a minute (like I read people felt earlier.) I don't know when or if it even stopped working. I took it around 7pm and went to bed  no problem  at midnight (my typical bedtime) without any issues. I know that I don't HAVE to take it every day at all  but my days off when I want to just sleep and be lazy  I take  just ONE 20mg pill around noon after I have been up for a few hours  and I am far more productive than I have ever been in years. I'm not sure how to go about talking to a doctor about my self-diagnosis  or if there are any other similar medicines that could possibly be prescribed without the overly judged and criticized name Adderall attached to it. Not sure if that helps anyone  but I do see a positive change definitely. I wouldn't use it habitually or for an extended amount of time.
,2/10/2012 9:04,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,13,This helped me increase my focus and concentration tremendously... I once was at a standstill in College  always wanting class to be over  never paying attention  ditracted and over stimulated by the smallest noises; I would find myself obsessing about the tapping of a pencil  rather than the professor. As a result  my grades suffered  self-esteem suffered   and I wanted to give up. I was prescribed adderall xr my sophomore year in College and I literally noticed a dramatic difference immediately. My grades went from a 2.4 and have remained at a 3.6. I do not recommend for long term use.

The other is that  just because a few bad apples chose to abuse this and similar drugs  I have to get a written prescription  every single time; no refills  no phone-ins.   So  most of the difficulties with the drug are legal  not pharmaceutical."

I heard a nasty rumor that they are about to come off the market soon.
,1/20/2012 3:20,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,4,28,I have only ever had been prescribed the quick release adderall and took 60 mg per day in three 20mg doses. However  when I moved and obtained a new doctor  he did not feel comfortable prescribing that dosage because of it being a controlled substance. Instead he switched and cut me off completely which caused severe depression and no motivation to do anything. When I asked about an extended release version so I wouldn't have the roller coaster effect he pursuaded me to try Concerta and Zoloft together instead... and let me say that it does not work for me (even after 2 months). I feel like I'm in my own world often and analyze everything way too much... Please someone tell him to listen to his patient and get off the adderall judging bandwagon. It does work for some patients  just saying.

She had been on Clonidine but it wasn't helping. It made her very tired so the point of her sitting  staring  nearly drooling on herself. When she started Adderoll it took a week to see real results  but it worked pretty well. She did have some issues with losing weight at first  but over time she gained back to the ""normal"" range. After almost a year of being on it  it became less effective. She started having violent outbursts  hurting herself and us  screaming  unable to pay attention  and very sad / crying often. I think for a while we had a good run  but when it was over it was OVER. It was like night and day how dramatically she changed when it stopped working. Also it is exteremly hard to find in the 5mg dose she was on. Had to drive to another town to get it. We're starting Ritalin now  hope it works better and for longer."

,1/8/2012 0:00,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,4,5,5,10,"I knew growing up that i had a problem with focusing & motivation for anything. i caused trouble in school to make the days more exciting or i would count repeatedly in my head & obsess on objects  instead of paying attention. (i also suffer from diagnosed OCD)after high school  i found myself breaking up my family & the life we had going for us  just so i could live my life on the edge with alcohol  pills  & sex. all because i was bored with life & i needed the adrenaline rush to stimulate my mind & body. i was officially diagnosed with ADD without hyperactivity at the age of 23 & started off with Ritalin  which didn't even touch my ADD. i'm finally taking what i wanted all along.. Adderall. i now take 30mg twice a day & it has made all the difference in the world. i can finally focus on tasks at hand  i have the motivation & energy to get things done  and people & things don't irritate me as badly as they did before. side effects? it does give you an addictive ""high"" that's supposedly comparible to cocaine  so i do see the potential for abuse. it causes insomnia for me if taken too late in the day or if i double my dosage  but i can take my next dose that morning & run like i had a full-night's sleep. i was 143lbs when i started taking Adderall (which is the biggest i have EVER been in my life  due to eating for comfort after the death of my sister) but i am now 126lbs after 3-4 months of being on Adderall. i literally have no appetite anymore.. unhealthy & i know this BUT i honestly love seeing my lbs drop. also makes my heart race at times & can be somewhat alarming  especially since my heart rate is on the high side anyways. the major issue i have had (that i haven't seen from other users) is my OCD is worse than ever now. maybe i'm focusing TOO much & that triggers my OCD? other than that  i think the benefits outweigh the side effects. thank you Adderall. sorry for the long story  but i hope my experience helps & someone else can relate"

I have a history of procrastination  lack of motivation  organized chaos and extreme fatigue/tiredness accompanied by worrying and anxiety.  I was treated for anxiety to start  pristiq.  Once  under control  My doctor started with a low dose of adderrall increased by 5 mg a day until I reached the point where I felt focused  locked in on my work and time seemed to fly by.  I reached 20 mg and maintained for 30 days.  The results where amazing.  I can't believe I went my whole childhood without this diagnoses.  Anyways  upon my evaluation my doctor ""upgraded"" me to vyvanse stating that it has a cleaner smoother release and I should benefit more.  The first day I felt like I was on cocaine.  I had lock jaw  grinding my teeth and felt like i was high which kept coming and going.  I gave it 2 weeks and had to quit.  My doctor switched me back to extended release adderrall and I'm symptom free.  My ADHD is under control and I'm functioning much better at work and home.  Eating was one of my coping mechanisms before so the decreased appetite was a welcome.  To combat  I keep lots of fruit  yogurt  veggies and nuts on hand.  My general physician introduced me to a book called ""Driven to Distraction"" which helped me understand my condition  the different variations  as well as ways to combat.  For me  exercise and to do lists are my keys to success.  Recently  I tried stopping pristiq to see if my anxiety was just a result of the ADHD but found I have a combination condition.  I wouldn't have understood this without reading the book so I highly recommend in addition to adderrall xr."

Adderall works really well for me  but I quickly built a tolerance to the drug. It now takes about 350mg of Adderall for me to focus all day in classes or when I am studying. I know that this is an unhealthy amount of the medication to take. I would suggest to anyone being prescribed Adderall to not quickly increase your dosage or you will build a tolerance. Now I never sleep and lost a significant amount of weight. Please help me  what do I do?

I was on an intense grad school load along with 50+ hour a week job and a large family. It allowed me to sleep more than 4-6 hours too. Mood swings were a problem but nothing like other drugs. If it were not for recent weight loss I would give it all 5s. Btw I go without for two days sometimes. I also forget to get a dose here and there...this encourages me when I see the addiction possibility. I exercise and eat right too.

My doctor increased the doseage and it is working better.Well there is a severe shortage of Adderall where I live.  I do not have any side effects from Adderall.  I like to control my meds.  What is an ADHD med to is similar to Adderall.  I do not want to take a time released medication.

Towlie,12/2/2011 14:49,(25-34),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,2,68,Here is the issue. ADHD Im diagnosed with by some phychiatrist. Other phychiatrist i have been evaluated by say i don't have it. They all have MD after there names so who is correct and who's incorrect??...I've been off and on adderall for 8 years. Im 28 years old. Yes it helps me concentrate. Yes  it helps motivate me. Yes  it even makes me feel better about myself...however adderall is extremly addictive  so thats the biggest issue with it. This is a med that is in high demand among society and can kill if it falls into the wrong persons hands. Drug users feel great euphoria and energy when they use it  simply put; thats why they use it. Prescription drug abuse is sky rocketing like never before. So parents keep that in mind.---SO-- The fact remains adderall helps a ton with certain people. If you plan to take it here are a few tips (not that im a dr.) 1)If you have a prior substance abuse problem  FORGET adderall 2)Take it exactly how directed by MD. 3)Keep it in a place thats secure  kids know ALL about adderall. 4)Keep an eye on your pulse  BP  and heart rate. The worst side effect i've expericed is becoming anxious on it. I am just trying to give a down to earth review  and i hope it helps some of you.

rngr9782,11/30/2011 13:23,(25-34),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,3,17,I get mixed feelings when it comes to Adderall. I'm a 25 y/o male that was diagnosed with ADHD 3 years ago. I took adderall (30mg  2x day) for the first 2 years and it worked well for the most part; there were two problems though. For one  if you forget to take your second dose when you're supposed to  you're going to notice...at least I did. Secondly  god-forbid I took my morning dose on an empty stomach; I'd feel really jittery and my mind would race at 100mph. Overall though  it did it's job. I ended up switching doctors at the VA (I'm a vet) and my new doc mentioned dexedrine. I was reluctant to try them  but he put on me on 2x10mg spansules in the morning and 2x10mg tabs in the afternoon. Here I am a year later a lot happier with the results. The onset is smoother  it's easier to eat on it and there are no ups-and-downs. I recommend looking into dexedrine for anyone who runs into these problems with adderall...Also  dexedrine is a lot cheaper than adderall. Generic 10mg IR tabs cost about $.27 each  while the 10mg spansules are 2.16each.

I am in grad school now (full-time job  husband  2 active kids) and I was starting to cave-in.

I can focus I am very thorough and I take on tasks that I normally wouldnt But then there r times when I feel like everything is a distraction or aggrivation unless its what i want to do.  then u hav the the issue of controlling the drug and tolerance to the drug.  if u hav any down time without the drug u will experience manic lows of no energy and depression. My whole body feels like lead and my ambition or interst in amything is pretty much slim to none. I dont know if I really need adderall or if I have just convinced my body that i need adderall. Either way  good or bad  I always want the adderall.

It works well and I love it. Unfortunately  I love it so much I take well over the recommended daily dose. I have built my tolerance up to 350mg per day  and it makes me feel awesome. About a half hour after I pop them  my heart will start pounding and hurt incredibly. Often  when remaining still  my legs or arms will go numb. I feel dizzy and weak all the time. I will also get severe chest pain and back aches. I do not sleep  and if I do  I sleep at the most one hour during the day. Concerning eating habits  I don't eat much and have lost a lot of weight. My withdrawals are hell  and unexplainably miserable. I feel sad  tired  hungry  bored  and hopeless. I will admit that these pills possess most of my thoughts. If I don't have multiple pills on me at all times  I feel very uncomfortable. Therefore  I at least need to have pills on me for the next time I need to take some.

Unfortunately  the manufacture of the reg adderall stopped sending out 2 pharmacies because of misuse n abuse by college attending persons.  Yet if u read ALL info  it says ppl truly needing medication DO NOT abuse it. News stations report that their brilliant idea DID NOT deter student abuse.  So for us that truly need this suffer the most.  Maybe schools should b addressing problem.  Torturing ADHD suffers DOES NOT deter. Drug abusers  it only makes them use the XR or Ritalin DUH. DOCTORS r suppose to b brighter than that  guess not. Just wanna thank u for what u have done to the ppl truly needing medication  GENIUSES in ur own minds

Teachers and parents said I was smart but wasn't ""applying"" myself which was totally confusing to me. After a series of attempts at self medication  I started seeing a therapist who prescribed Adderall. It has changed my life in every way. I feel like the normal person I always imagined everyone else to be. If you need it  you'll know because it won't cause the ill side effects that some describe. I eat normally. I sleep like a baby. The only drawback for people like me is that it's becoming harder and harder to find."

It also helped my depression helps me sleep better at night (due to me wearing my self out & not napping during the day) the only negative I can think of is I seem to have developed a tolerance and for some reason my Dr. won't increase my dosage even though I've been on the same dose for all this time.He has even mentioned taking me off of it for some reason to which I replied I'd rather stop the pain meds!! Adderall is the BEST thing that ever happened to me in a Dr.s office!

Even then my racing thoughts would take me off somewhere else thinking about what i was trying to think about in the first place. When i started Adderall everything changed. My grades went up my social skills were at 100% and life had some meaning instead of thinking that my life needs to be over. So taking this drug off the market for what reasons i could only think of rather than people selling it  or abusing it should not have to change the other 85% of the world that needs it to go along with there normal living.

I find it helps me concentrate and get things done. I like the XR even with insurance is so muh higer per month almost $500.00 per month verses 30.00 per month co pay. this makes no sense to me. I'm now 50 years old and started taking it about 4 years ago and it's been a life saver.. warning your insurance might consider this a mental disorder as my BLue Cross Blue shield has.

I did not take it for ADD or adhd  I was prescribed to it because it helped speed up my seritonin levels and would make me social. For that  Adderall did its job with flying colors. It's speed after all. I loved how it would make me clean and get stuff DONE! people called me ""super Mark"" (my name) 
  The only problem was I would ""crash"" terribly from it  get depressed   and it would greatly supress my appetite and im already too skinny for my age. If it wer not for those issues. I would still be on this awesome pill."

Adderall has change my life for the better I can finally apply knowledge and get through the boring things life. I have been set back my whole life and in the past few weeks have made great leaps in my personal life  work environment  and in college. Bad desicion making is at zero while medication is in effect. I've also done a lot of research and on th topic of ADHD and Adderall. I am troubled by the media misconseption of data and effectivness of sitimulant medication.

JaymeV,9/29/2011 0:33,(25-34),Female,Caregiver,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,8,My son has been on many medications for ADHD and so far Adderall has had the best affect on him with few adverse affects. His worst reaction to this medication is that he does not want to eat. That has been one thing that all the medications he has been on has had for him. He is better able to focus and is easier to talk to  he listens to what is being said to him and actually remembers more than one thing at a time.
CoachAllen,9/28/2011 20:00,(45-54),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,9,I have been taking Adderall for about 5 years now.  I was more aware of the changes & feeling better ( more focused & even) when I first began.  I am living proof that not everybody shows the typical side effects associated with Adderall.  I can say that I never lost my appetite or had any additional weight loss (hoped I would) when I started to take it.  My metabolism remained slow.  Today I am not as aware of all the positive changes.  That being said  on occasion I ran out for a day or two and noticed how lousy I felt.  I would feel very tired and depressed.

AMYT87,9/27/2011 17:55,(25-34),Female,Caregiver,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,2,"My son who is 8 1/2 has struggled with reading with no improvement despite various tpes of extra help and instruction. He was very implulsive with his behavior always ""acting before he thinks""  grades at school were very inconsistant. He was failing to ""grow out"" of certain behaviors. 
Since starting Adderall ER 20 mg a month ago the change in him is amazing. He is now able to read on grade level  make good choices and is more socially confident. This drug was our missing link for him  we were doing everything possible for him and it all came together once we added the medicine. He is no longer receiving supportive reading services at school. He completes his homework in a timely manner with little assitance  last year it took an hour plus to do 20 mins of HW. It truely has changed our son's life and improved our family. Get your child tested for learning disabilities and ADHD/ADD if you have any concerns. My son didn't fit the mold of what ADHD/ADD looks like but upon testing he presented with Behavorial and Cognitive impulsivity  with a reading disability. Just starting 3rd it was critical to figure out the best way to help him reach his full potential and be happy.
We do now give him 7mg of melatonin to help him fall asleep 15 mins prior to bed. He was 20 lbs over weight from implusive eating and so far has lost 6 lbs. So that was an unexpected plus for him. Overall we are very happy with Adderall and the improvment in our son.He takes it at 8 AM and it lasts until between 6-7PM  it wear off gradually."

Then i sometimes had those days where i felt kind of depressed  usually when there was nothing for me to do because on adderall  i wanted to always stay busy. other then that i lied the way it made me feel. wheni wasn't taking adderall  all i wanted to do was lay around watch tv and eat. and its the complete opposite when i'm on it. Another effect i get when i'm taking adderall is i feel the need to become a perfectionist. everything had to be just right. i mean in school when i was taking notes and they were written sloppy i would later after i'd taken all the notes i would redo them so they were neat. overall though i do like adderall

It makes me less ""spacey"" and able to do simple tasks (like brushing my teeth  for example) that I would regularly forget to do.

dtathomas,9/13/2011 10:03,(45-54),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,21,"I started Adderall-XR after my doctor ruled that I was ADHD  which I was very reluctant to believe. I had a history of suicide attempts  depression  anxiety  violence  etc.  which was attributed to a specific event  - being raped by our parish priest as a teenager at 13. The drug Adderall  made it possible for me to be focused  on task  centered and a lot more accessible to psychological treatment which lasted almost 9 years. I am a much better person for doing the treatment  I continue to take Adderall. It is the only ""psychological"" drug that I now take and was misdiagnosed for over 30 years. Work with your doctor to tweak this drug  to the just right amount - you'll be glad you did. I am just one of the many that lived through a horrid  tumultuous life in regards to the rape  upbringing  violence  etc.  and just trying to find the real me. A compassionate  loving  understanding and forgiving me buried deep under the ugly layers  of hell. I wrote a letter to my doctor and expressed the aforementioned and that he could read it to any patient that he desired - if he felt it would ""connect"" with that patient. My final words would be do not be afraid to ask questions  investigate  get second opinions and never have blind allegiance to one doctor. We all make mistakes and are not perfect for we are truly  only human - it is our nature. Anyone desiring to discuss what any medications have done for me were always welcome but you cannot base your results on someone else. You can only use it as a loose guideline for your own personal situation and physical makeup. That is where your trusted physician comes in and although they may be right on the money regarding one drug that works for you beware - they do not always remember all the drugs you are taking so that is where the patient must be vigilant  especially when being referred from specialist to another doctor or specialist. I bring an up-to-date prescription printout to any new doctors as a new patient. Thank You -"

FlyByTurkey,9/6/2011 13:57,(25-34),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,10,Where to begin... I decided to start seeing a therapist when my anger and irritability issues were having an impact on everyone around me including my children and my girlfriend and her daughter. I have always had these issues but I can also be a very fun person too. After a few visits with the therapist and asking her for help with the anger among other issues including concentration. She gave me a test for ADD and failed miserably. Went to the Dr. and he prescribed 20mg Prozac a day and 10mg of Adderall twice daily. WOW! Slap in the face and one happy son of a gun. For a week it was weird because of adjusting to the meds. Not much sleep and felt foggy and strange but that went away. After a couple of weeks I upped the Prozac to 40mg a day. Worked a lot better for me (28 year old male 215lbs).  I tried not taking the Adderall on the weekends but I just got distant and irritable. I thought it was the Prozac so I tried stopping it and just taking Adderall. Nope  that didn't work. I got easily car sick and real irritable. So just went back on both at the same time until I could talk to my Dr. about switching or something. I decided to try upping the Adderall by splitting on in half and taking 15mg in the morning and 5mg later in the day. I felt a lot better on a higher dose. I decided to save up a few extras and try to take 20mg in the morning and 20mg later in the day. WOW! That is a lot different feeling. I can really concentrate now and I actually get up and do things and finish them instead of just wanting to but can't seem to just do it. My girlfriend (now my wife) is loving it. I taught her daughter how to ride a bike  cleaned up the garage and organized it (which has been a dump for a long time) and I cleaned up my office (boss has been on my butt for a while). Best part is  I love that I am a person now. Cure for depression and anxiety

I changed doctors to stay on it. I found taking half pills  10 mg at a time  is best for me. If I take one half of a tablet after 3pm I have some trouble sleeping. My prescription is for 2- 20mg a day. I rarely take more than one.

No side effects of insommnia/or iritability. Now  60 mg decreased motivation  energy and sleepiness  however I am on other prescription meds  so I am working with Doc to change others and eliminated Welbutrin and the sleepiness went away. My motivation is still out the window  but when engaged in a task  stay focused. Pretty irritable  at times  but could just be me.

My marriage suffered greatly  but I had a great husband for 32 years until he died.Since his death in 2005 my life was just existing for no reason. Then I found another psychist who gave me ADDERALL 20MG times a day along other meds  DR changed and added higher doses of meds. such as 300mg seraqual 300mg trazadone  klonopin 1mg 3 times a day and cymbalta 120mg  with the adderall  this has been the best combination of meds for me. I know feel like a different or normal lady. Thanks for the adderall. I reccommend adding adderall to most chronis depressed people. Don't knock it until you try it. I wish I had adderall years ago  me and my husband would have had a more outgoing life. I am 54 and stated to really live.

She had me start on Adderall and life became much easier. I could stay on one chore and not get nearly as distracted. It has a real calming affect. I can organize my life for the first time ever. My kids see a huge difference in their mom. Seeing that I battle with bi-polar1  PTSD  major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder  Adderall I can honestly say does the most good for me! If I could say one thing that is the very most important- Never take this med more than what your Dr. prescribes! I have been taking Adderall going on 4 years and I am taking the same dose as I did when I started taking it. I wonder how many of you out there can take an adderall right before bedtime and fall asleep in a half hour or so? I try not to  but I can. Take care-

I would like to add that insomnia  is one of the side effects of ADD/ADHD  not Adderall. I have always had insomnia  and only recently found something that works  the herb Valerian. Valerian seems to have no side effects  but it smells bad. I take it 1/2 hour before bed with warm water  or make a tea with it.

ajsh,8/18/2011 23:23,(25-34),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,4,5,7,I have struggled with adhd my whole life up till age 34 without meds. My parents were against it. I was in a relationship with someone who has adhd just as bad as I do and it helped until she got locked up . My symptoms went ape sh*t on me and I couldn't even focus on anything AT ALL and started 10 projects a day. Before I could see a doctor  a friend gave me some adderall and I am amazed at how much more calm  focused and relaxed I am. My doctor prescribed me generic welbutrin and it was horrible. She wants to try ritalin now but I'm convinced that Adderall works for me. I have to pay for prescriptions will my health ins starts so I can't afford some meds. Life with adhd sucks!

I take it in conjunction with several other prescriptions (Abilify  Pristiq  Xanxax and Klonopin to name a few. No noticable reactions to other meds. Would like the adderal ER but a 30 days supply on my rather heavy dose was recently quoted to be $780 something for 1 pill daily. Fortunately  the regular is not too pricey  as low as 30$ at NY Duane Reade. Very  very helpful."

I stopped taking it towards middle school and gained alot of weight and asked to b put back on it in 8th grade then I lost all that weight and was very happy. After getting pregnant at 18 I stopped taking it immediately and did not start taking it again until 4yrs later after giving birth to 3 children. Again it helps with not only energy  focusing  but also weight loss. Amazing!

Eiheiken,7/31/2011 12:21,(25-34),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,15,This medication has helped my ADD tremendously especially in the work place. Some side effects though more so from coming off of it when I take drug holidays they are usually spent sleeping on the couch. When I take it though I do very well and usually by the end of the day sleeping is not a problem. However it used to be a problem when I took the XR version. Now I take the plain old fashion immediate release tablets 30mg at a time. Once in the morning and then in the afternoon or I break my afternoon in half to make an additional 15mg available to take closer to 4

Too bad I found this when I was as old as I am. 66 going on 67 in 2 mos. I am using my time to heal my mind and thinking process. I am able to choose my thoughts now. I have many sources of healing the mind etc  so since this works for me  I think one needs therapy as well.

Nick,7/4/2011 20:13,(45-54),Male,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,15,"I am on Adderal XR. I began with 20 mgs and that worked for about three months. During this time I did not suffer from any side effects.But I began to feel ""out of it"" again and found myself struggling to focus and being overwhelmed with all my tasks. I also (again) had problems with impulsiveness and not being able to ""think clearly"". I asked my doctor for an increase and he then prescribed 30 mgs a day. It did help. I also discovered that the generic did not work for me. I am experiencing dry mouth as a side effect. With the medication I've estimated that it has decreased my impulsivity by 85%. I believe it has taken a years time and a bit more for me to see the maximum effect of the medication. It's as though my brain needed that much time to get ""soaked"" by the Adderall XR. I am now in the place where I am now starting to deal with developing good habits to overcome my great disorganization. I am trying to strengthen my ability to think linearly.  When I first started the medication (at 20 mgs and again at 30 mgs) I found disorganization unsettling and I became neater for a time.  I then again became sloppy and I was bothered by the fact that the sloppiness didn't seem to bother me. Over all I'm happy with the medication."

My academics have greatly improved and my ability to start  continue  and complete a task are a complete change. However  like many others have said  you quickly grow a tolerance to it. I have noticed an improvement with this by taking 1-2 days off a week. Those days are of course a little rough but the only thing that has helped me from the tolerance issues. I also have sleep apnea and if I'm having a rough day it sometimes makes me feel even more fatigued. The ""crashing"" after the medication begins to fade is sometimes worse then simply not taking it at all. So far the only medication I've tried for ADHD but overall a good medication thus far  not sure If I'd say the same if used for sleep related disorders."

I was the absolute worst person to deal with in the morning and it took so much effort to get my day started.  Struggled for years with sleep issues during the day and honestly thought I had other medical problems.  I take the IR version because my insurance won't cover the xr  45mg when I wake up and another 45mg around 1pm.  Come down is a bitch  but by the time it happens  everything I needed to accomplish is done.  Just drink lots of water and avoid vitamin c or caffeine 2 hours before of after your dose.

Improved morning with less coffee  much less dropping items and able to stand without dizziness. Improved sleep nights and return of normal appetite.

Concerned in 2011 May of ""industry wide shortage"" of this old and proven drug! Is f d a warning mfg causing shortage? Where is it all going?  At age 57 need to stay awake and continue right choices  and help my adult children and grandchild by staying awake. 

No side effects of being off only Rx needed to improve retired-disabled lifestyle. Slowing mental and physical activity is occurring during lethal heat of summer. Needing much more coffee to function during less waking hours  now."

Joni,6/1/2011 23:35,(35-44),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,3,26,I started taking Adderall 4 years ago.  I noticed a difference immediately.  I no longer had panic attacks  I was able to focus more easily.  Less fender benders due to not paying attention.  I will say that after years of being on this medication I have developed a bit of a tolerance for the dosage I am currently on.  This is a medication that you can and will build up a tolerance to  and it needs to be adjusted according to individual patient history and patient need.  The dosage should be adjusted according to patient need.  Afterall  each individual patient is unique and different.  I am a bright  intelligent 38 year old woman who has ADD  NOT ADHD.  There is a difference.  This is the only medication I have found that works for me.  I can concentrate.  I am not having panic attacks anymore.  I do experience upset stomach at times.  I think the benefits outway the side effects.  If you try this medication and it does not work for you  you most likely are not truly ADD or ADHD.

The only side effect that we have noticed in him is having a smaller appetite. Adderall has calmed him down enough in order to focus and cooperate while in school. Without Adderall my son is VERY hyper and impulsive and cannot focus on one thing for very long. He also talks A LOT when he is not taking it  it seems like his mind is racing a mile a minute. Deciding to put our son on Adderall has been so beneficial for our son and his success in school. He is a much happier kid!

I am careful not to misuse this drug  and that serves me well as I avoid tolerance.  I use 5mg about 0-three times a week.  I am very happy with the control I have now over my depression which causes me to lie down on my bed listlessly all day and not go anywhere  see my friends or want social contract  engage in recreations that I enjoy such as horsebackriding.

I wanted to fo these things  but somehow I could not make myself do it. I have learned excellent coping tools through the years and did not take medication for my ADD. After four failed marriages and filing bankrupcy twice I finally asked my doctor for medication. I tried the Adderrall ER and it did not work for me. I am now taking 20 mg of Adderall in the morning and 20 mg at noon. It has changed my world.

ADD Neuro Crackhead,5/22/2011 14:38,(45-54),Male,None,None,Other,3,5,5,2,Diagnosed Manic Depressive but Possible Neurological Damage  ADD. I was forced to see shrink again with Interferon Treatments. Good thing too because I was fighting with the desires to kill people. While on treatment I relapsed into crack use due to the depression caused by interferon and the Antipsycotic meds I was given. My son was struggling in school and displayed many of my life long traits. He was diagnosed ADHD/ADD Opositional Difiance. They gave him Adderall. I hear bad things about ADD/ADHD meds so I previewed his meds having abused many drugs in past. At 10MG I felt like I was coming down off of crack but when the crack dealer called to deliver that I said no with $1500 in my pocket. The nerve pain I lived with daily level 7 on 1-10 was gone. Local pain down from 7 to 4. Manageble with Ibuprophen. I no longer wanted to kill people and even smiled and laughed when I should again after 30 years of not doing this. I felt normal but over medicated. I reduced my dose to 5MG from 10MG because of this so I don't feel this is at all addictive for me since I don't want more than enough to treat my symptoms where life is normal again. I now can listen to people where before they'd talk and I'd go yep  yep  yep and never understand a word winging it hoping I did not miss something important. Best of all I now realize I may have neurological damage and will be seeking a better eval after I finish Interferon treatments. This med saved someones life be it mine or yours. I wanted to kill you without it. I also have no struggle with Crack Addiction and could actually sell it without using it if I wanted too. LOL. I can't believe how well that fixed something I struggle w for 25+ years that cost me enough money to buy Miami. WOW! Thank you Kids School for interfering w my life. I may actually have one again.

My doctor prescribed me a low dose of adderall that I take daily and it has changed my whole train of thought and has limited my obssesive compulsions. I love this medication  it has helped me alot.

I also struggled with some OCD issues.  The Dr. decided after testing that I was on the obsesive side of ADHD and prescribed low dose XR with low dose IR.  It has done wonders for my work and daily life.  I have less stress. I don't get upset when I have to divide attention between multiple things  I actually get all done with excellent results. Then on the other side of my OCD like issues; if I am working on one thing alone I don't over analyze it too much  I just get it done.

gherri21@aol.com,5/7/2011 13:08,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,3,I have been diagnosed with depression since my mid 20's. I've been through a number of antidepressants and while they seem to help for a while  as I've gotten older the duration of effectiveness seems to grow less and less. I was started on 20mg of Adderall along with my Zoloft and I don't know when I have ever felt better or more clear minded. For the last several years I feel as though I was walking around in a fog. Now I can focus on what I need to get done and I don't keep asking my kids the same questions that I asked them 5 minutes ago.

lilo,5/5/2011 20:53,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,8,I have stuggled with attention problems  problems in school & at work  and distractibility for as long as I can remember. I'm 20  and I was just diagnosed with ADHD (without the hyper-active) part a few months ago. I stared out on Adderall IR 10mg once daily  upped that to twice daily  and now I'm taking 20mg once daily. It has helped me beyond belief! I don't know how I lived without it! School is going great  my job is going great  I'm able to stay focused and do the things that need to be done! I'm hoping to start taking 20mg twice daily  but I think since I've just started on it  my psychiatrist just wants to make sure my body is handling it okay. I do get a headache occasionally  as well as loss of apetite and sometimes I'm not able to fall asleep quickly  but that just depends on what time I take it. I'm taking 18 hours in school  night classes  5 nights a week  and I work during the day about 4 days a week  so I have long days. What time I take it really depends on what's on my schedule for the day. I'm new to all of this  but Adderall has been a lifesaver for me.

Sliske,4/24/2011 17:23,(13-18),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,3,12,I was about 12 years old or so when I started taking Adderall. People said they noticed an immediate difference- my grades improved  I started paying attention  I was more obedient. Then  by the time I turned 13  I began to have chronic stomach pains  which continue to plague me to this day. At the time  I was battling ADD  depression  anxiety... you name it. The stomach issues were just another thing to add to the list. By age 15  I had an endoscopy  and it discovered I had a condition known as Eosinaphililic Esophagitis (I think that's how it's spelled) as well as an ulcer. I continued taking medicine to treat everything  until I had the idea to just stop taking my medicine altogether. That was at age 16. For more than a year and a half  I experienced NO pain whatsoever from my stomach  my depression faded  and I was still able to focus as well as I was able to on the drug. I haven't taken it since  as I haven't felt a need to  though I still take the stomach medicine as needed. Bottom line- Adderall interfered with many of the other drugs I was taking to treat other things  and kept me in a state of perpetual pain. But I was always alert and focused  so technically  the pill did its job. I don't see how everyone says this pill is addictive  I find it far from that. During the time I was taking the medicine  I continued to gain weight until I was nearly 300 pounds. Now  it's been almost 2 years since I've taken them  and the weight melted off naturally  I'm down to 175- lighter than I've been in years. I feel better  and I still can focus as well as I could on the drug  despite not taking it. All in all  I wouldn't really recommend taking this drug if you take other medicines in conjunction  but it surely gets the job done if you don't mind the agony...
,4/22/2011 23:44,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,4,3,29,"Whether or not you have ""ADD"" adderall will help you concentrate  get things done  be more efficient etc.. Im a Senior in college.. 95% of people use it to study. If your kid says this isn't true.. they are lying.. or a freshman.. or from Idaho. I was tested and given 20mg pills... at first it was amazing. Not only could I sit down studying for my exams for 10 hours straight (literally) but it felt fun to study. Class was all of a sudden so interesting. Loooong story short  after a few months of using it off an on (about 3 pills a week) the effects changed. Yes  I could concentrate better when I was alone studying/doing school work. However  when taking adderall I felt like some kind of zombie. Like.. I couldn't smile couldn't laugh  didn't want to talk to anyone..(Im usually very extroverted). The day after taking adderall I sleep until about 2 or 3 pm. Ew! Typically I wake up at 7am and cannot sleep past 9 am! Once you start using the drug it is hard to get off it. Example"
Lina,4/21/2011 10:54,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,15,Just started taking this about 1 month ago. It really works for me. Before  I had trouble concentrating and finishing tasks. Even minor things on my 'to-do' list (like mailing letters  making phone calls etc.) would feel like a huge weight on my shoulders. Adderall helped with all of those issues. I take between 5mg - 10mg per day. Anymore than that would make me tense (I'm surprized that most reviewers here seem to take much more. Sometimes reviewers even call 20-30mg a 'small dose'--not for me!). I split it up--half around 9am  the other around 1pm. It's true it'll keep you awake at night if you take it too late. Other pros

My symptoms have changed over the years; more anxiety  less depression when I was younger now its more depression with less anxiety.  My thinking became disorganized.  I was forgetful and easily distracted.  When my doc suggested this med I was very concerned it would increase my anxiety level but agreed to a trial.  That was over 5 years ago.  My energy level is increased  I'm much less forgetful  my mood is improved and there was no increase in anxiety.  When I've stopped the med my mood plunges  my energy level drops  I become irritable and I'm miserable to live with.  I take 40 mg every morning and sleep well.  I did have a trial of the XL version but found it ineffective.

dude,4/18/2011 18:10,(25-34),Male,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,10,"I have beem on adderall for about a year now. I started with 39mg 2x a day. It was a ;miracle; drug. I had motivation  great concentration and I was like superman. I could work out for hours non stop for hours and stayed up for up to 5 days in a row just cleaning and remodeling the house. With tine the medication looses its potency because u develop a tolerance. First was 60mg a day than 90mg  than 129mg and now im on 159mg-30mg 5x daily). I used to be able to take hakf of a 30mg tab when I started and be superman. Than taking it oraly did not work for me unless I tripled my dose. So I started crushing and snorting the drug. Right now my tolerance is so high I can snort 150mg very easy. Whats next 180mg? Probably My One time I lost my pills and I was literally narcoleptic  sleeping about 16hrs a day going through crazy withdtawals and not knowing what to do with myself. I felt I was literally going to loose my mind. I was so sick(head sick) that I could barely make my doctors appointment to get a new script. If I didnt have my xanex for the withdrawal I probably would have killed myself.
This drug is very effective but also super sddictive. The sad thing is they give this drug to little 3 year old kids whos parents cant be real parents and want a magic solution that comes in pill form. Think about it amphetamine=adderall. Adderall is lagalized speed. How do you give a 3 or 4 year old amphetamines. Their four and supposed to be roudy and have alot of energy and stamina.Their $!!!!!
Overall I think its an excelent drug if it is prescribed properly by a doctor. It helps my depression and fatigue problems as well.Motivation  concentration  determination=dependance."

Although it has helped me focus on tasks and allowed me to complete projects without a problem it has also made me almost obsessed with whatever the task is that I am doing. For example  I wanted to clean my pantry counter  a quick spray with some cleaner and wipe it down  no big deal right. About three hours later I realized I had cleaned the counter  the stove inside and out  the dishwasher  sink  floor  and organized the cabinets. It felt as if I had to keep cleaning until everything was perfect and it just feels strange. Some may say that is a good thing but If I had video taped it I probably would of looked like a crazy person while doing it. Also  I lost a good amount of weight since taking Adderal and now I feel I am to thin. I am 5'7"" and my weight was 155lbs before the Adderal  I looked healthy. My weight went down to 132lbs and I looked sick but did manage over the last few months to get up to 145lbs. I take 50mg a day  30mg in the am and 20mg around noon. I have tried lowering the dose but it did absolutly nothing for me and without the second dose I end up crashing and want to nap by 2pm so the seond dose is basically to keep me going till bedtime. I do have trouble sleeping and even more trouble waking up but once I take my morning pill a half hour later I am good to go. Well that is my experience with Adderal so far  oh yeah  one more thing to add. I don't know if this happens to anyone else but I notice my hands and feet feel real cold at times and even though I will be sweating I am always cold. Well take care everyone  hope everyone has a great day."
Luleena,4/13/2011 23:03,(45-54),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,3,4,3,5,My doc wanted to give me more Zoloft for my depression  but I was afraid it would make me tired and gain weight. Since I was also complaning about having difficulty concentrating at work  he added 10xr adderall. (i usually only take 1/2 - 2/3 of the dose tho.) It has definitely helped with my mood and with concentration. It has also made me just slightly more aggressive which so far seems to be a good thing  since I tend to hide when it would be good for me to assert myself. It gives me gas tho  and although sometimes no appetite  I haven't lost any weight! Am a little anxious and worry about it being addictive.

My feet used to literally turn blue. My legs in general were always bluish. I went to dozens of doctors over the past decade for a diagnosis. I even proactively asked the doctors if adderral could be causing the awful calf pain (which was the result of such poor circulation). The doctors all told me ""no"". FINALLY  I found an incredible doctor who researched my pain extensively and told me that adderral may indeed be the cause of the freezing cold hands and feet  as well as awful pain in my legs. Adderral is AWFUL to get off of. VERY DIFFICULT. I'm now off adderral and my pain is 90% better and I no longer have blue hands and feet.

,3/10/2011 15:52,(19-24),Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,11,This medication was like being born again. My constant impulsive behavior and concentration issues had been plaguing me for as long as I could remember. I was misdiagnosed when I was younger but went back as an adult and was prescribed Adderall XR. It's like I can do things other people have always had an easy time doing  and overall it has allowed me to make more rational decisions.
Lionheart,3/7/2011 23:15,(19-24),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,4,21,"This medication has its pros and cons. I've never been able to focus on anything for more than 30 minutes at most  especially with work and school. It took a while to figure out what worked for me  but due to insomnia I use the instant release tablets since they wear off by the end of the day. I take 15 to 30 mg per day and it works wonderfully. I feel like I can actually function like ""normal"" people. The downside is that this is a stimulant so it will wake you up and makes sleeping difficult. It also causes a loss of appetite  which can be rather difficult to deal with. After taking a dose  it becomes nearly impossible to eat. Even forcing food down with liquids is a chore. It's as if food has no appeal or satisfying taste. Another negative side-effect of the instant release tablets is the comedown. Since this is a stimulant similar to speed/cocaine/meth  it can have an intense comedown. I become very easily agitated (little things will set me off)  I get headaches  and I overall just feel sick. This is more intense if you haven't been eating throughout the day and if your taking a higher dose. Being aware of how crappy the comedown is makes it easier to deal with. I now can control my mood very well during my comedown and it now rarely affects me. I am not recommending this since it is an illegal solution (unless you have a medical prescription)  but ""herbal"" use has been extremely helpful with the side-effects. Once my day is over and my comedown is beginning to make me feel sick  a little greenery goes a long way. It removes all the negative moods and headaches  restores my appetite  and helps me fall asleep. I can not believe such a helpful drug is illegal  because I would be (more) underweight and sick without it. It's what works for me and my prescribing psychiatrist is aware of my use  but I'm not here to preach about it.
Basically  Adderall side-effects can be ROUGH  but without it I could never manage to work 8 hour days or sit through night class."

I do find that close monitoring of this drug is very important. Also quiting smoking  interatctions with other medicaitions that can effect the heart is very important to discuss with the doctor. Also taking holidays from the drug is difficult with the side effects but helps to decrease tolerance and decrease having the medication dose increased. With taking these steps this drug as dramatically improved my life at work and home.

stud4studosu,2/23/2011 7:51,(19-24),Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,5,2,"I have higher than normal blood pressure  so I stopped smoking and reduced my caffeine intake before asking my doctor about it.  I would have been considered a light ""on and off"" smoker; probably 3-5 per day for a few months  then I'd stop for a few months  and repeat.  

Two weeks afterward  I decided to go out a few nights and had a few cigs at the bar.  The next day when I took my Adderall  I had an immediate urge to smoke.  It was to the point that I wanted to smoke up to a whole pack in a day.

Being as it's a stimulant  it definitely helped me focus on schoolwork.  I've been on a number of psychiatric meds  most of which killed off my libido and led to sexual dysfunction.  My libido went sky high  but it destroyed my ability to perform.  I'm sure it was caused by the Adderall in addition to smoking because I checked my blood pressure about a month later and it spiked to 165/80.

I also have seasonal depression  and during this period the Adderall made me irritable.  Eventually  the depression killed off the effects of Adderall.  I just started an antidepressant  so hopefully this will correct it.

Be very careful if you have high blood pressure  smoke  or consume excessive amounts of caffeine.  If you anxiety  depression  or bipolar disorder  as I do  you may have better results with the Adderall in treating ADHD."

The only negative I have noticed is my patience isn't as great as it used to be. An added bonus though is that I am thinner now than before I got pregnant with my twins.

Shyboi30,2/16/2011 17:20,(25-34),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,2,1,25,I'm a 30 year old white male who is a recovering addict from meth. I'm diagnosed with ADD w\o Hyperactivity. My life has been a stuggle. I lived with this disorder untreated for most of my life. this is how I found my way to meth addiction before I found out my real problem.  I want everyone to know that this medication is nothing like meth. A lot of people say that it is and a lot of people believe that it is. Let me  being someone who has experienced both. Tell you that it is not at all the same.  To be honest with you I wish that it was. Do not think that in anyway I'm trying to say that meth is a good drug in anyway. What I'm saying is  is that meth for people with ADD is a form of self medication and its addicting to us because we become normal people. I had high hopes that this medication would have some of the positive results that meth offers and none of the negative attributes of that drug.  I'm pretty sure I can tell you why this medication is addictive to people though. I've been on a lot of different medications and have learned well how to evaluate their effect on my life. This medication is the most difficult to figure out dosage and the most inconsistent medication I have ever dealt with. This medication can be addicting for us because we are tired of living our lives with ADD. When you take the medication and get varied and inconsistent results you want positive results so you take more to try to find that place where it helps you and remains effective. Its not a medication that you can just take the dosage when your supposed to and it will do what its supposed to. So far I'm not pleased with adderall. I will probably ask my doctor for something else on my next visit and pray that something else will work better for me. I know that this medication helps some people and I really wish that I was getting those kind of results. It would be nice to be able to speak with other people taking this medication and see what their experience has been like.

KaeMae,2/11/2011 16:21,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,9,I was diagnosed with depression years ago  took all the usual garden variety anti depressants and nothing helped  in fact several made it worse and quitting Paxil was the worst 6 months I ever endured. So my therapist decided to look for alternative treatments. She gave me a ADD test  I guess you could call it and almost 80% of my symptoms overlapped with ADD. So I started out with 20 mg XR Adderall  it worked great  was on it for 3 months and recently I have been changed to 30 mg XR  which works even better. My symptoms have all but disappeared  I have a new lease on life  I can't believe what I had missed all my life  this drug really saved my life

Josh,1/31/2011 15:46,(19-24),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,4,4,18,I have taken adderall for about 8 years now.  I have some mixed feelings about it.  I would not recomend it because of soo many mood swings  and it is very addictive.  It really helps me like the hour after i take it and after that i feel tired and disinterested and not in a real good mood.  It also made me lose my appatite in the mourning and I would have to force me to eat then later on in the afternoon I would be starved cause i hadn't ate much earlier because the pills made me not hungry.  This stuff did calm me down to some extent but I became a whole different person when I was on this and it changed my personality and that was not a good thing.  My grades in school did greatly improve on this stuff.  And it does work immediatly when I take it.  I also noticed though when I took this it made me focus but made me focus on things I shouldn't be focused on.  This makes you feel awake when you first take it then like right after lunch time you feel completly ezhausted and you can't focus on anything  plus i would get headaches every day.  This stuff did temperaily put you in a real good mood like 15 min after you take it then all the sudden you were in a bad mood.  This stuff works great for like a couple years  then after a while you feel addicted to this drug and like it consumes your life.  There are too many ups and downs with this and a different moods every hour.  And without this drug I am not a moodie guy at all.  So I would not reccomend this stuff at all.  This stuff will mess you up.  Try Ritlen I took it for a while it seemed a bit better.

I am a 26 year old make and have been feeling very down for almost a year to the point of wishing to die everyday. I have always felt it even as a child  but recently decided to seek help. The doctor prescribed me Celexa 20mg at first  I took it for a couple weeks and really didnt notice anything. He upped it to 40mg/day (Celexa) and after about a month on it I started to notice a change. It happens pretty slow  and it is subtle. But now I am much happier  I can talk to my family now without getting an attitude  and I have an overall feeling of ""life is good"". The only thing negative I noticed about it was sometimes I would feel zoned out  or staring off into space. So the doctor prescribed me Adderall 10mg twice a day. I have only been taking the adderrall for about 4 days but let me tell you... this drug can work for you or against you. The first day I got it  I didnt take it early enough and was up all night. The second day I took it in the morning  and then in the afternoon. The first time taking it the feeling was intense. One pill makes you not feel much  but after the second one you get euphoria that last's for about an hour or two and you have the feeling of being on coke or something. I was unclear for a couple of days how to use it because I didnt really feel like I could concentrate. So today I reduced it to one just before I took my test and found it to be ok. It isnt what I thought  I know it would work better if I took the second dose  but i didnt want to seem wired today  and I wanted to get a goodnight sleep. As far as mood goes  the Adderall put me in a really good mood  non aggressive  and also very relaxed (even though I felt wired and cracked out). I want to know what I should do  because 1 dose in the morning is ok  but the second one really enhances the situation  clears my head up and allows me to concentrate  but like I said the feeling for a few hour"

At the time my mother refused to put me on medication because she feared I would be put into special ed classes. I hated school  with a passion. I was bored with what I was being taught  and focusing on doing homework was impossible. After dropping out of high school  and moving to a different state  I got my GED and started college. I talked to my doctor about my problems in the past with ADHD and she started me out on Concerta  which didn't do anything at all. She then switched me to Adderall XR 20mg once a day. For me this medicine is an absolute miracle. I can't believe the difference it has made in my ability to focus  not only on school  but living life in general.

This drug definitely does not work for everyone. I have read a lot of reviews about children having negative reactions. A close friend of mine's son was taking 30mg a day at the age of 12. He also has MANY other psychological problems as well  and Adderall turned him into a monster. His rage towards everyone around him was unbelievable. When he stopped taking it his behavior improved tremendously. In my opinion I think doctors are giving kids way too high of a dosage. 

Withdrawals from Adderall is a nightmare. I've taken a few breaks from it for about a month at a time within the past few years. I slept at least 16+ hours a day for a week straight. When I wasn't sleeping I was eating. The mood swings were terrible  and I had NO patience for ANYTHING or ANYONE. But after about a week I was almost back to normal. 

Adderall sometimes makes me very compulsive.  I will occasionally obsessively pick at my skin  and once I start its really hard to stop. Not many people experience that. Also as a smoker  it makes me smoke A LOT.

I also found that Vitamin C pretty much blocks Adderall from absorbing into the body. Once I stopped drinking juices w/ vit. C  the Adderall worked normall"

I made the mistake of taking it later in the day around 4pm and was up all night. finally rested around 4am for a few hours until i got up. i havent really noticed the ability to focus more because it has been thrown off by the wired feeling. i will give it a try for a few more days  maybe cut back to just one a day. i didnt think 10mg would be strong  but it messes me up.
,1/5/2011 19:31,(19-24),Female,None,None,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,5,6,I just began taking adderall 10 mg twice a day. I am able to concentrate in classes and study for more than 5 minutes  however I don't feel like myself. I don't eat  I'm not as outgoing  and I'm certainly not as happy. The mood swings are also apparent.. One minute im crying  followed by a feeling of elation. I also haven't slept in a few days. I could never fathom giving this drug to a child!
,1/5/2011 17:48,(13-18),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,5,4,16,Sure adderall works wonders  it made me a straight A student  extremely focused  and very chilled out. But to me the side effects are not worth it. Its overkill  it made me like a 'zombie'. My dose had to be raised at least yearly to even work. After being on it for over 8 years I decided to quit taking adderall because i felt it consumed my life. And the withdrawl symptoms where horrible. I was constantly tired and moody  and had a uncontrolable urge to constantly eat  i gained tons a weight. So basically I would not recommend adderall and even thought it is tough to deal with ADHD  i would recommend just overcoming it instead of medicating.

Copperredgirl,1/3/2011 15:55,(35-44),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,4,6,Adderall lifts my mood and allows me to concentrate at work..all parts of life. My one concern is the I sometimes find myself focusing on what is in frot of me and not what I need to be focused on. It's hard to change gears sometimes. Multi tasking has proven to be challanging at times too especially when it comes to forgetting or spending to much time on one of the many tasks to be completed. I prone to nervouse energy and it does make it worse sometimes and better other times. I recently started taking Klonipin with adderal and the combination is really working for me. I have the focus of adderal  but with a calmer approach to just about everything.

It seems to make multitasking ten times harder.

Up until recently the entire experience with the medication was great. I recently started having heart palps and other very severe side effects and have had to stop taking it resulting in terrible fatigue withdrawl. It is a great medication while it last. My doctor actually said these types of medicines one should not be on for more than two or so years due to the severity of the side effects that come later.

I finally found a dr. who actually took the time to TALK to me and observe me before giving me a label or a prescription. As it turns out  I have ADHD. We started with Ritalin  but the peaks and valleys were too much. Plus it made me feel REALLY anxious. Now I am on 30 mg in the am and 20 mg of adderall in the afternoon. This medication has been a miracle for me. I can actually complete a task and I no longer burst into tears just thinking about compiling a grocery list. The only side effect I am experiencing is an upset stomach.

He was prescribed 10mg once a day but the doctor told us to half it for the first couple days. This ""medication"" should be banned. My Sweet careing and yes incrediblly hyperactive boy has left leaving behind an angry anxious boy who has spend the last week in tears. I see NO positives about this medication and SO many Negatives. Today was day 7 and the last day my son will ever take this medication. I would take the worst hyperactive day then to sit by and watch my son cry all day. I just wish I hadnt put him through this in the first place. Please think twice before you do."
sheabirdie39,12/15/2010 20:12,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,4,7,I went on this medication after being diagnosed with ADHD. I did really well on it   but it got too expensive for me to use; no insurance. I don't recommend going off this med without a doctor monitoring. When I called and told them I coudn't afford it and needed a new med  I was told it would take 2 months. I had a horrible time coming off of it; very emotional  aggressive and irrational outbursts over small things  foul language and inability to concentrate with moderate depression. So yes this medication works well for ADHD but coming off it is another story.
HappyCamper,12/15/2010 3:57,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,8,Adderall really helped my add. i was on concerta in highschool and i made me depresses  so i went off add medication for a year  then my dr. suggested adderall and wow what a difference  i can actually focus  be productive at work and school and not feel the depressing effects of concerta. I dont feel any adverses side effects other than the fact that its a little harder to fall right asleep  but that dosent happen when i take it on school days because i take it earlier before i leave for class.

trader,12/11/2010 19:43,(25-34),Male,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,1,1,22,I am 34 year old male that was first prescribed this drug over a year ago. I have been on and off antidepressants since about 25 for panic attacks and depression which seems to be to  genetics. It seems I had a low lying depression for years that I never realized but soon became clear when I finally went to a doctor. I never liked meds so I was on and off of them. Nothing had really changed for me in life so i was always self diagnosing and realized(i thought) i have ADD! All the symptoms were there  told my doc who is prescription happy and gave me a script. No tests  no medical screening  just a script for 20mg 3X daily to START OFF. Giving someone that much of a hardcore narcotic who suffers from panic and depression is just beyond me. Sure it made me concentrate  big freakin deal...I always did well academically without even trying. It also made me lose all patience  had zero personality  and just withdrew from life  didn't eat or sleep and depression worsened. The toppper is that within a month I was in the emergency room for what I was certain was a heart attack. So I threw out the pills  but again I decided another shot but lower dosage. Same results pretty much. I know this drug helps countless people but if you take you better damn well make sure that you have ADD for real and not just making excuses for your failings in school  work etc. And please if you read this  and you have depression and get panic attacks don't even think about touching Adderral or any other stimulant drugs. How the FDA could approve something so dangerous and highly addictive and abused is beyond me. They should just go ahead and legalize cocaine while they are at it and tax it. Bet the nation's deficit would be gone in a year!

,12/8/2010 11:41,(45-54),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,9,I am 45  and have been taking Adderall for several years now. It has worked very well for me  as i am now able to complete tasks  and think more clearly. I will say  in the beginning it gave me the jitters  like drinking a pot of coffee at once. After a few days  i felt like my life had some order to it  as opposed to feeling like i was going 90mph  in 100 different directions. I have been on a few other med's for ADD/ADHD  but they didn't work for me. The only negative thing i can say about Adderall  is i do have some short-term memory loss  but nothing major.

I was originally diagnosed with Bipolar disorder  but after changing doctors I am found to have ADD. After researching I found that my symptoms are almost 100% on. As a child I was very hyper and what I considered to be ""outgoing"" but I never really achieved anything. Didn't get in much trouble other then talking to much  or being a class clown until after high school.Normal mornings without Meds I could barely get out of bed I had been angry and frustrated with  MAJOR depression  and this is as soon as I get up!I just felt like a failure! Everything I do seems like such a task appointments or family gatherings have been like pulling teeth for me.Honestly getting into the Drs is a life saver. Because I couldn't have been that miserable for much longer. I know I just started taking this med.but today when my alarm clock went off I hopped right out of bed and made breakfast for my daughter before she was even up.I normally would go back to bed once she went to school and I have been up since.I feel happy I even felt good last night.I am worried bc my blood pressure gets high when I am stressed out or upset  and I worry about the adderall making that worse. But I'm hoping that it will help ease my stress bc I wont be behind on everything rushing to catch up and get things done at the last min.(thats how I've been living my life) I mean even my sons shots were 6mths behind  and thats a major health concern for my child and family.My homework and health has been put off for so long.I've lived w the anxiety that I will fail at everything I do.I am ready to live a normal meaningful life.I have always been a good Mother as far as giving my children all the love they can stand =)But now I am ready to be the Mother that can teach my children by example a good role model who isn't sleep all day either!I have had a couple lilheadaches only lastin 10m thats it.I feel brand new now!20mgs allday& last dose@5 slept good.30mgs/2today"
scout_finch,12/6/2010 2:01,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,8,Adderall has been a lifesaver for me.. literally. Before switching medications  I had been on Strattera in high school  which had left me depressed and without any change in my symptoms. When I started college I switched to Adderall and it made a significant different in my academic performance and improved my self worth tremendously. My only side effects were weight loss and insomnia  which eventually diminished after my dosage was correctly adjusted. While I am extremely satisfied with my experience on Adderall  I understand that each drug is different for every person  .. but I still think people should be willing to try several drugs and dosages until they find what works for them.. because effective treatment TRULY makes a difference!

momof2va,12/2/2010 1:56,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,8,I have only been taking Adderall for 2 months  but I think it has saved my life.  For the longest time I couldn't understand why I couldn't focus on one thing  or start something and never finish it without going on to something else.  I've been diagnosed with depression since I was 18 and tried just about every one out there. Nothing helped  i usually ended up feeling more depressed.  I almost felt paralized in my own body  there were so many things I wanted to do and needed to do and just couldn't.  Since taking Adderall  I am completely focused on what i need to do  i actually have the energy to do what i need to do and overall feel like a new person. I haven't had a job in over a year and I'm living with my parents currently with my two children.  In the past few weeks  I have gotten a job and started to look at apartments.  Let's just say I am making a lot of positive changes in my life and i feel like the adderall gave me the motivation i needed to do it.  hopefully everything works out  and things keep looking up!!!! i would recommend this to anyone who feels the way i used to. to me  it's a miracle drug.

Go to the DEA or FDA websites. It is an highly addictive drug. Over a period of time it causes pretty much all the side effects associated to it. Watch who and how much someone is taking. It might start out ok but check over time  6mo. 1yr. Watch for symptoms associated to this drug and really think about other options before taking it.

Mimi,11/1/2010 21:16,(35-44),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5,5,5,2,My Dr has prescribed the 30mg Amphetamine for me for two reasons. 1) for help with my current meds  to assist in the proficiency of them  as well as for trtmt of reoccurring depression.   Two years ago I suffered a back injury on the job. I have worked as a FF/Paramedic for the last ten Yes (8 now b/c of injury) and it has cost me not only my career but working again at all. I have had surgery and there's nothing more to do to fix any remaining problems. My neuro has made it very clear that at the age of 42  I have the spine if a 70+ yr old. With this info   I've hada Very hard time accepting this ESP at my age. I became a grandmother just 2 1/2 weeks before my injury as well. The amphetamine in conjunction with my other meds has def helped.   I take 30mg in the morning   and 15mg in the afternoon.

It has helped with all those things.  Although  sometimes instead feeling outgoing and attentive  I feel very nervous and therefore can't concentrate on anything except how I feel.  I think this may be a result of drinking too much caffeine.  Also  during the summer  I would sweat profusely.  Even now that Fall is here  I still feel hot at times.  It's almost a double-edged sword for me.  I say that because it's working very well for me  but  at the same time  I'm worried that I'll become addicted to it.  In my case that's a legitimate fear since I used to take a lot of opiates and benzos.  I don't abuse the Adderall though.  I don't like the ""speedy"" feeling  plus I realize it's very dangerous to do so.  Overall  my rating is a"

My doctor and I wanted me to be able to sleep less and be able to be awake during the day and function like normal people. I was given Adderall 10mg  one a day. no change in my sleeping was noticed. We increased the dosage to 20mg  and I have only taken one yesterday and one today. I would like to know the best time of day to take the medication to get the best effect. I know that the suggestion says to take it upon waking in the morning. Will taking it in the morning be effective for me  because my problem is sleeping too much  but not narcolepsy. I just want to sleep normally and be awake a normal amount of time.
I hope someone out there can give me the answer  I think Adderall can help  but the time it is to be taken by me is very critical. Thanks.Pat"

It is the only medicine that has helped me be able to physically get things done. I have been and tried many medicines. Before I was on it I physicaly could not get off the couch. I have always taken the generic product non-sustained release. I hope I remember to ask my shrink next time to get me on sustained release. I had life tradgedies that made a mild depression severe. As it is a controlled substance I like what one of my counselors said ""A bad medicine for a good reason."" I gets me from non functional to close to average energy. It does not get me feeling euphoric or high. On the street its called speed. I am a recovering alcoholic of 19 years  I am taking it to help me survive  and I always take it as prescribed. I was on it from 2006 until Sept. of this year 30mg 3 times a day. If I took it after 4pm sometimes hard to fall asleep. My new shrink reduced me to 30mg twice a day  I feel I have lost one third productivity.

Recently in the last year I noticed radical changes in my behaviors and sypmtoms.  Not being able to focus  concentrate  lack of desire to do tasks or jumping from one to another to another and never getting anything finished.  On top of that my sleep patterns changed in a way different from my PTSD symptoms.  I began to stay up all night for no good reason and sleep most of the day.  Formally  with the PTSD I would not be able to go to sleep at night with racing thoughts about the war or I would go to sleep and wake up in sweating from horrible nightmares. Now it's like I have both going on except I seem to not have the racing thoughts about the war so much  in fact  hardly at all.  I recently started taking 20mg of Adderall XR last week but it does not last long enough and I only feel just a little bit more like doing tasks and finishing them.

Anti-depressants added to my already present symptoms of fatigue  brain fog  and inability to focus. My psychiatrist was hesitant to prescribe me Adderall due to my past history of using illegal drugs to eliviate my symptoms.I wanted to find something that could help me function without the stigma and lifestyle associated with illegal drugs. After two years with the same Dr. and close monitoring of the affects of other medications  he finally decided to try me on the Adderall. Before  I would start out to complete one task  and end up with 10 unfinished tasks and no desire to complete any of them. After the Adderall  I noticed a difference the very first day. The ability to start a single task and see it through to completion was a wonderful feeling. It has completely changed my life.

I'm still getting the timing right so I can sleep well at night. I do take meds for anxiety  seizures  atypical depression  and tremors with muscular contortions. Thought adderal would really agitate all this but all I do is shake a little bit. I drag a lot between doses and my concentration goes away. I feel really physically hungry when I'm hungry  but every food seems repulsive to me. I force myself to eat. I've had really tight muscles  partly because of occasional contortions  partly from adderal plus scoliosis. I do a lot of stretching and see my chiro.

Me in a BIG WORLD,9/14/2010 16:53,(7-12),Male,Caregiver,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,28,My son is 10yrs old in the 4th grade (held him back in 1st grade due to failing while he was getting diagnosed.) He started taking Adderall @ 10mg 1x per day in the AM  5 months ago. He is ADHD with all the hyperactivity and lack of ability to focus on any tasks  no matter how minor they may be. He was diagnosed at age 6 in the first grade. We have tried at least 8 different medications in the last four years. As he grows  the meds seem to sometime lose their effect after a certain period of time. Concerta was great for almost 2yrs and then we tried various others till we found Adderall. It worked GREAT! He stays focused and we do not have any side effects at all! Not even the loss of appetite which was always a problem with the other medications. I am very pleased with this medication  and at times this may be frustrating as a parent to go through finding what works for your child. But once you find the medication that works for your child  it definitely is worth everything to see your child succeed at all he does  especially in school. My son is a very caring  loving and happy child and have never had any problems as far as anger issues that many people might mention. He is just full of energy and cannot stay focused on one task  school assignments or just doing things in order such as fix your bed and next clean out your back pack....he may start the bed but will soon be jumping in the living room having not completed his bed or much less totally forgot about his back pack...

I've been prescribed the other meds  but for the past 10 years I've been on the same dose of Adderall (20mg t.i.d.) and nothing works better. With Adderall I am able to focus  think before acting  I'm much less anxious and my temper is curbed. All of which give me much more confidence in the things I do. Hell  it even helps me sleep better!
Prior to diagnosis w/ADHD  I had a brief stint of drug use (and I know that's a contraindication)  but in all honesty  Adderall was of great help in stopping those behaviours. It's amazing what can happen when a person gains cognitive clarity & patience to assist in positive decision-making.
Although it can increase anxiety in some and if you have cardiovascular issues - forget it  I highly recommend at least a trial of this medication if you have ADD/ADHD. It continues to do wonders for me."

Raeleigh,8/20/2010 3:56,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,9,I was prescribed adderall 15mg once daily at first for ADHD. I would take it at about 8AM and by lunch time it was worn off and I just crashed. My doctor then prescribed me 20MG XR once daily. This has worked so much better for me and seems to last about 7-8 hours. Side effects when taking 15MG immediate release tabs
huggybearbarry,8/17/2010 5:35,(65-74),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,5,5,15,"Years ago  I had a TIA & it gave me such a ""wild"" sensation (whole left side went numb) that I shall never forget it. Years after that  I had a tingling sensation that was so similar to my earlier TIA  that I thought it was an aura signaling another onset of a TIA or worse yet  a full blown stroke. So I made a ""beeline"" to the ER & the ER Dr.'s had no idea what it was. So  they got on the phone with what I'm calling a ""lifesaver"" as he (Dr. Alan S. Zacharias  a ""guru"" of a neurologist here in Boulder  CO)  knew  once they told him all the Rx's I was taking  e.g.  Adderal  what was going on  i.e.  that the Adderall was the problem  told the ER Dr.'s that info & had them tell me to stop taking the Rx Adderall immediately. I did & the tinglings went away forever. That is ONE STRONG Rx!!! Now  I'm taking generic Ritalin & no side effects  i.e.  tinglings. So  now on to this wonderful WEBMD website. It's here where I found that those who've had a stroke  or in my case  a TIA  should NOT be taking Adderal -- therefore  thank you for being so inclusive  exhaustive  comprehensive  etc unlike the PDR where no mention was made of that contraindication. Thanks  Barry"

But in addition to that diagnoses of ADHD I was also told I had Bipolar Disorder. Now that I am in my 20s I have a worry about the long term side effects. Every doctor I have asked assures me that there are no proven negative long term effects of taking this medication for a long period of time.  But I can help but think otherwise. It is an amphetamine after all. Other issues I am concerned about have been the effect it has on me when I stop taking it completely. I am very tired and don't really know what to expect or I'm aware of things that are going on around me but can't really grasp the concepts. I have tried the none Extended Release Adderall and it was very unsatisfactory! BLEH! I would take one in the morning and then one in the afternoon and I had major side effects  tremors  ticks  I kept clenching my jaw and I was very unhappy. I am satisfied with the results and ease of the XR tablets. But I still think about the long term side effects...kind of feel like a lab rat considering every doctor I've asked about them seems to think that I'll be fine...I guess I'll find out  eventually...

With minimual side effects  at a dose of 20mg / day.  My pharmacy did make a mistake of dispensing the generic once. The pills are identical  but the side effects were not.  With the generic I experienced sever cramping  mood swings and extreme irritability.  It took another month off the generic and back on brand to rectify.  I also notice that not stopping over the weekends or on holidays  and keeping the regular dose without fluctuation  gives me a consistant benefit.

Linda,7/27/2010 10:49,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Other,5,5,5,2,**** Adderall helped me get through an intensive graduate school program by allowing me to focus on my reading assignments and projects after a long full day at work. It also elevated my mood. I felt happy that I was managing work and school well. I never abused the dosage and took it on a daily basis with the approval of my doctor for a year and a half until I suffered from a ruptured brain aneurysm. I never had high blood pressure and my EKG was fine before starting the medication. I did notice that my BP had gone up while on the medication but I just attributed that to the extra demands of grad school and a new teaching position. I was one of the Extremely lucky ones to survive the ruptured aneurysm w/o complications. My neurosurgeon said that the rupture could have been brought on by the use of this drug and demanded I immediately stop using it. Because of this I would not recommend it's use by anyone. I'm a teacher and would rather see kids or adults bouncing off the walls or daydreaming away then lying in a coffin.

My ability to focus now is incredible. I rip through tasks with ferocity like nothing I've experienced before. I'm however  admittedly  struggling with mood swings from a euphoria feeling to a ""crash"" feeling.  The drug gives me a speed-like euphoria that you will have to learn to channel into whatever productive task you need to accomplish. 

There is a huge potential for abuse here so be careful.  I've also experienced a some issue with hyper sexuality from this drug.

It will absolutely help you focus  but this drug should be respected at all times due to the abuse/ addiction potential."

So pretty much everything that most of the things people are saying they are going through in these reviews  they have already come and gone with me.  But the last is the hair loss with me.  Right now Im going to a dermatologist just to figure out my massive hair loss problem.  I fear I will almost be bald by the end of the year (but mostly because my last dermy was a moron and never even ran tests). My suggestion is get her to a Dr.  Get a blood test or test the scalp tissues.  Thyriod/depression/stress/hormones are easily grouped and can be disguised.  And with this disorder is hard to figure if its just you or could actually be an underlining problem.  I have my other dermys apt tomorrow.  Ill respond when i have a better problem with whats going on with me because i can almost guarantee it might be the same thing.
red,7/4/2010 15:19,(19-24),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,9,"Currently I am taking Adderall XR 20mg a day and have been doing for about two weeks now. Three months ago I was initially prescribed 15mg of the XR. I have a more inattentive form of AD/HD and I immediately noticed a difference in my ability to focus and concentrate  especially in school. However  as others have complained I notice it does seem to wear off a bit. It's possible I need a higher dosage for more effectiveness but I noticed I have begun jaw clenching and my dry mouth is insane! Although it's possible the dry mouth is from my Depakote. I have a Mixed Bipolar co-morbid AD/HD diagnosis. This medication is overall quite effective and can make a life changing improvement for some. However I want to caution this medication shouldn't make a person with true  AD/HD feel ""tweaked out""  sped up  or high. It should just elevate awareness  focus  and an overall attention to detail. That's why I agree that it is safe for kids truly suffering from this diagnosis should take a stimulant medication such as Adderall. You will notice immediately if these medications will be a right fit for you."

Do me a favor and eat a couple of his pills  this is not a drug for 7 year olds please trust me. My parents did the same thing to me. Most ADD/ADHD med will make him worse  These pills drain happiness. Keep it up and your on your way to a very difficult acedemic career. People that have ADD/ADHD have an intelectual advantage  i beleive most people that say they have some type of attention disorder are full of it. If you want your son to be sucessful  push him in the direction of his passion  not yours. I was pushed in directions against my will most of my childhood. I dropped out of highschool got in trouble with the law  the whole shabang. I now attend the 3rd top business school in the country.

Now I have been takng what they call Cognitive Energy Enhancers. They are over-the-counter and are basically a combination of a 5 Hour Energy and a brain vitamin. But they work!

I can relate to the person who said someone can talk to you for 10 minutes and you don't remember a thing they daid. I too use adderall for it's intended porpuse. Unfortunantly  I also use it and have abused it a lot.I moved 2 500 miles about 12 years ago just to get away from what was the meth Capital of our great country San Diego at that time. Thank God meth is not a major problem in Western Pa.However  adderall and meth are soooooo much alike. I encourage anyone out there to really think twice before putting your child on adderall. First I would get a second apinion from a Dr. who knows about addiction.2nd I would look at the families addiction history. If you must put your child on adderall I would only do so as a last option where you have tried everything else. I do not mean other drugs I mean like counseling  tuitering  sitting down with your child and helping him or her with homework. I mean really try to find out why they are having trouble focusing and try to solve the problem without a drug. Doctors are just so to quick to give you a drug or to put a lable on you. I can talk to 9 out of 10 head Dr.'s and in 15 minutes I can have them lable me anything I want them to and that is sad.I honestly believe most of life's problems are in a persons heart not our head.Please talk to your pastor as well. I think that is the first place I would start. Im talking to the man in the mirrior more than anyone and I pray someone out there knows exactly what Im saying and it's time for this great country to get back to place where we can get our hearts right with God and repent for all our sin and I truly believe our world would be a better place. If anyone out there is addicted to adderall you can get help at a place called the rolloff homes. please go to pbc-roloffhomes.org you and /or your child can get real help. no ins.needed.no money  u wont b turned away

Aidaleigh,6/12/2010 0:50,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,4,"When I first started taking Adderall it was after trying several other meds without much success. I was able to concentrate  focus  much less impulsive.
Unfortunately I build up a very quick tollerance to medications. I am on the maximum dosage (after being on it just 1 year) and it is almost like not taking it at all.
I also am having the problem previous reviewers have stated with teeth grinding. I have tried mouth guards  I destroy those in no time. I have always been a teeth clencher  but now I exessively grind my teeth when the meds are wearing off for the day.
Overall I have been very happy with the Adderall>"

Peaches0324,6/10/2010 8:52,(45-54),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5,5,5,8,I was diagnosed with Clinical Depression when I was 38. I've been on about 10 different antidepressants since then. I am now 53. I am doing so well on this since it was prescribed to me by my physciatrist a year ago. I take 30mg. twice a day. I now clean my house  organize my life and activities plus joined the gym. I've lost a little weight  I gained a lot on the antidepressants  and continue to slowly lose it since I've joined they gym. I've never slept much since I was diagnosed with the depression but I can now sleep a good 5 hours a night and feel rested. It does  however  make you sweat a lot. I sweat a lot anyway living in the south with the humidity  but this makes it worse. Sometimes this is a good thing. I think I need another does though. During the day after my second dose  which is late in the afternoon since I get up so early  I start to wind down too early. I still go to bed late and get up by at least 5 every morning. I've always been a morning person but I think I do need an extra dose. I'll be asking my doctor for a third pill to take during the day so I can get things done in the evening. It has helped me so much I recommend it to anyone that has depression and anxiety issues like I do. I've not had a panic attack in about three months. I've found that certain situations and people trigger those. I've learned to avoid them. Hope this helps someone in need.

When does this medicine start working and i have a weird taste in my mouth.

But once your body gets used to the drug  you need to increase the dosage in order for the drug to ""keep working.""  After being on the medication for a couple of years  the patient slowly feels like a ""speeding slug""  where you are feeling energetic from the drug  but disorganized where it's not getting you anywhere  but giving you anxiety."
,6/6/2010 21:12,(35-44),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,5,12,"well I have been on Adderal for about 7 yrs.  I am now taking 240 mg a day..thats 2 30's 4 x a day.  I almost think that dosage is to high..  but when I try to cut back  it is impossible for me to do.  I'd rather take none at all (which that I cn dio easily) than just take say half the prescribed amount.  But my old habbits are back and worse. I still make my lists  ect.  but I go off on so many rabit trails while doing the list  the list never gets done.  It almost takes me 3x longer to accomplish anything.  For me to pack and go to the lake  it takes me s good 6 hours.  I no all this is not how it should be..but I think i am what they call Tweaking out on it.  I think I will go aff it competely then go to 30mg x 2 a day.  One more thing.  When I don't take my adderal for a few days  when I do take it I have to start off on VERY small dosage.
Thanks for all the reviews  I really showed me what I alreadty new in my heart...  plus it gave me the re3commended dosage for amount to take a day."
,6/5/2010 3:00,(25-34),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,5,7,"Adderall seems like a miracle pill at first  but like most amphetamine based drugs that aren't entirely clean... it comes with a price.

First  it IS very expensive now  even though Shire doesn't even make the pill.  Teva makes the namebrand now...  also the price is now higher  even the generic XR capsule.  Dexedrine is a better drug for ADHD  but is also easily to become immune to  and you're once again  F'd.  

Adderall's negative side effects were not noticed by me for almost a year.  I worked out every morning  went to class  and had baseball practice after school.  College  drinking  bad habits  and the effectiveness of the drug were all part of the problem.

Ritalin or anything like Concerta will probably make you more nervous  and give you a worse headache.  So far  Dexedrine has had the least side effects but comes with a negative stigma attached to its name."
,6/5/2010 0:48,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,15,I have struggled with ADHD symptoms since I can remember.  I only recently started taking medications as my symptoms got worse after having children.  I tried Ritalin before switching to Adderall.  It has helped me more than anything I have ever tried to do on my own (making schedules  writing notes & reminders  not taking on too many things at once).  It just made life so much easier.  I don't have accidents at work  I focus better  I finish what I start and dont procrastinate.  I also am able to get to work on time and not be as stressed and irritable.  However  I have been on it for two years and I have had issues with not being able to take it for a few days or a week sometimes and I definitly felt that there was a dependence even after taking the correct dosage always.  I dont like the fact that Adderall is so addictive whether you abuse it or not.  I want to be put on something else so I dont have to worry about that  but i think that the outcome outweighs the risk...unless another medication can do the same job without being as addictive physically.
Bill Mc,6/4/2010 21:13,(55-64),Male,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Other,5,5,5,6,"Male  Age 60  for Adult ADD. Taking it approx 18 months. Prescribed generic Adderall 20mg twice daily. Usually split the dose into 10mg 2 or 3 times a day. Skipping dose completely 2 days in a row each week so as to not have to increase the dosage. Works very well for me.  Helps me to focus and accomplish what ever I may be working on. Also more sociable and more tolerant of others. Good for anger management. Spouse notices the difference and supportive of my taking it. Some initial weight loss 5 - 8 lbs but have since regained it.  Just eat at meal times and try more highly seasoned food (easy on the salt).  Also drink more liquids. Best to not take it late in the day unless you plan on being up late. I still sleep at night and usually take a nap in the afternoon. Some people complain about excessive side effects and not liking the results.  Well see your MD and maybe try something else.  As for me  ""it's just what the Doctor ordered"".  Wish I had known about this medication years ago.  It's a real help for me. My results far outweigh any side effects  which I find to be minimal."

I am in exactly the same situation.  I am 25 and I have been on unprescribed(street) adderall since I was 13. For the past 9 months I have been prescribed 20mg tabs 3 times a day.  I was a grinder prior to any stimulant use.  My grinding wasn't so bad until I actually got my own script.  I am actually wearing out my teeth on the right side(I'm right handed).  I chew those night guards to bits. I really don't know what to do about the situation either.  My dentist just told me  ""Try to stay conscious of your teeth grinding and focus on not doing it.""  Does he honestly think that 'trying not to' wasn't my first god **** idea?"
Photogeekette,6/2/2010 20:33,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,4,6,I'm 23 and I have been taking Adderall Instant release for like 3 months or so now. I started at 10mg twice a day then three times a day. And then it was upped to 30 f twice a day. I dont have insurance and couldnt afford the XR. It works amazing for my ADHD  but I am grinding my teeth so bad and clenching my jaw. I was a grinder before starting the medication  but it has just made it a whole lot worse. I'm calling the DR. tomorrow about it. Maybe there is a different medication that wont make me do it as much. I've been wearing a mouth guard for years now  but I do it while i'm awake. I did it while I was awake before starting the adderall too tho. Its just making it even more. And I dont have money to go to the dentist. So I guess Ill just have to do the whole guinea pig thing untill i find something that helps with the grinding.
Nancy,6/2/2010 19:03,(25-34),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,21,"Okay so anything that actually works can be called addictive because you actually need it to accomplish things the normal person is already getting done...I don't sleep till 1pm anymore and yes the house is clean and things are becoming more and more organized.
As far as moods go (I know its not FDA approved) I take Damiana by Nature's Answer and there Black Cohosh with no adverse reactions or side effects along with my Adderall multivitamins and fish oil and yes my husband is very happy as well.Set aside some time for the kids even if you have to take a break from the cleaning... And forget the Xanax because that will just reduce the Adderall you are taking.Try to get the doctor to give you divided doses of the Adderall instead of one large dose-it costs more but much more effective and remember when it comes to Adderall dosages sometimes less is more... Effective....10mg BID or 15mg BID both are better then 20mg or 30mg a day.Also be sure to take them at 8am and 12pm-4 hours apart...You should be sleeping fine by night time -Ambien should never be needed and if it is your dosage needs to be decreased..."

Feeling of nausea pretty consistent-loved the weight loss. My heart felt like it was going to beat right out of my body! I stopped for that reason. maybe I should have given it more time...maybe I will try it again because at 63  just lost another professional job  made a really dumb mistake and honestly could not remember the correct information....still can't. I take an anti-depressant but it does not help me prioritize or use time productively and effectively.

I had been living in utter chaos for my entire life until I began taking this drug. I had to deal with two very suspicious and discriminating doctors who were ideologically opposed to the notion of ADD! My current doctor is very supportive of the meds transformative effects  and monitors my progress very carefully. I have to go in for check ups every two months. I have been on the med for 3 years. The first year  10mg once a day was effective  now 10mg twice a day OR 20 in the morning is what I take. The negatives are...muscle soreness  dry mouth and terrible breath  and excessive sweating. I try to go one day a week with out taking it  and it is truly a holiday- relaxing and mellow. **CAUTIONARY TALE** my husband came to abuse this drug in the last 3 years and wound up in a 12step program (thank goodness...)

Ive only been on it for 3 months and i have built up a tolerance.  I dont want to take more than 30mg a day because its unhealthy and only going to continue to build higher;however i am simply not getting the same effects.  I used to get a rush of euphoria where i loved everything everyone  and had thousands of aspirations--short and long term  i could do Anything for extended periods of time--including studying physics (ugh) for 6 hours straight......now that happyfeeling lasts maybe 45 minutes and i still have to work at reading.  i dont have the motivation to paint like i used to go to the gym  or leave my house. Honestly all i ever do anymore is organize/clean my house and study for a couple hours.  But by 7pm i am completely wiped out  listless  detatched  irritable  edgy  apathetic  social anxiety ect.  I used to drink alcohol socially now i drink atleast a glass of wine a day to cope with the irritability. AFter reading this one may wonder why i wouldnt get off.....its because im addicted.  i may only have 4-5 hours of productivity and studying  (i have board exams to take) a day--but thats more than id ever get done without it.  When i wake up in the morning i feel great  for about an hour  then i get so tired i almost cant make it to the adderral bottle to get my 1st dose.  i cant imagine life without it  however its depleting my social life and increasing my risk of cardiovascular problems. I dont know what to do anymore!

muchbetter,4/16/2010 14:02,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,14,After years of being treated with anti-depression medications  finally being diagnosed with adult ADHD  has been the key. Proper treatment has made me the person I was always hoping to be. Staying focused and organized is helping be successful.
paintedacres,4/14/2010 6:30,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Other,4,5,5,2,I found out that I was ADD almost two years ago. I never figured in a million years that I was until she described my issues to a (T). I agreed to start taking this drug and in the beginning it was a shocker. I was so amazed how alert and focused I was and wished I would have had this throughout school. I did well in school due to getting beat if I didn't but I could have done a lot better and at least been able to retain the information. As an adult I have found it very hard to keep my impusliveness under control. I have issues with spending. I am not a shopaholic but I buy for other people when I know I shouldn't and I over eat very badly even when I am stuffed. I can't control it. It eats at me until I almost have a panic attack. When I buy things it is always for other people not myself. This drug has helped somewhat with that. It at least makes me think about it first. But while I am doing better with it  it still is not cured. I still struggle with the eating and the buying everyday. At first it helped with the eating quite a bit. Now after a year or so the effect has worn off and I tend to eat more than I did however not as much as it was before. My doctor says that you dont get used to the drug and need to take more. You only do if you misuse it. Well I have not misused and I can tell you it doesn't work like it did and I find myself needing to take 3 to 4 10mg pills (fast acting) when before and even now my script says to take 2. I am scared to go off the med since it is helping in my job and keeping me on track but I am scared to keep on with it and get to where I am abusing. I don't think I ever will however I am getting used to it. I am also scared to take other meds for add since a few times I have changed scripts for depression and it has messed me up.

,4/2/2010 13:15,(35-44),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,3,7,I am diagnosed with Adult ADD. I can really tell a difference since Ive been taking this medicine. I work at a hospital and Im a student in college. I can concentrate alot better at work and school when I take it as opposed to not taking it. I went from Failing algebra to highest in class so that should amount for something! I have tried the adderall XR and didnt like it as good. It didnt hold me thru out the day and my doctor had to prescribe me the regular adderall to take after 5p. Soo I just told him I would go ahead and take regular adderall three times a day. What made me change is I didnt like have to take it constantly through out the day. I also didnt like the way it makes me feel when its getting out my system real sluggish. I know when I get to feeling like that to take another one up to three a day.

tklawsonpharmtech,3/22/2010 3:31,(45-54),Male,Caregiver,5 to less than 10 years,Other,4,5,4,3,Over seven Yrs. ago  Dx w/ ADD (no hyperactivity component) but lethargy  procrastination  incomplete tasks  hypersomnia  low energy  depression not well amaliarated w/ SSRI's or similar Tx. Slowly titrated  a gradual marked improvement in every catagory-and some not mentioned above. Within < 1 Yr. truly remarkable effectivness beyond expectation. Even after seven Yrs. improvement continues-and personnally  for me at least  the increments of highly complex retention is-even many fold. Today- myself  unrelenting. Well tolerated  Adderall increased the cumulative component of technical and organizational skills. NO boundries in relation to unrestricted FURTHUR clinical cognitive retentive upswing-NO decline-only MORE and better results to report to this day. The titration of tailored tid dosing most amenable to tapering  titration as needed PRN.

Ashleytickle,3/18/2010 11:35,(19-24),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,1,5,26,This medication is absolutely horrible! DONT EVER USE IT! I was on it for 6 years and became highly addicted to it  all i wanted was more and more. It made me very angry at everyone and extremely emotional  my boyfriend at the time was also on it and he became highly addicted to and was so violent he beat me. Also i wouldnt sleep for days at a time and started picking at my face all the time to the point of where i had sores. And another strange side effect which will sond crazy but it made me CRAVE cigarrettes  i chain smoked the whole time i was on it. As soon as i got off it i instantly quit smoking. It took about 3 months to completely stop thinking about adderall. And now 3 years later i cannot remember hardly anything from the past 6 years  i was a zombie and didnt realize it. PLEASE DONT TAKE THIS.... PLEASE

Laura P.,3/16/2010 18:47,(55-64),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,3,2,9,I took Adderall Oral for a couple of years.   It seemed like the effect wore off quickly  and I was often jittery sometimes to the point of feeling like I was having a heart attack.  Also  ADDers often have a problem with forgetfulness.  About 50% of the time I either forgot to take my afternoon dose  or when I did remember  I found that I had forgotten to bring my medication with me. About year and a half ago I switched to Adderall RX Oral.  What a difference! That drug has greatly improved the quality of my life. Sometimes I forget I even have ADD. Recently my prescription drug plan changed its rules so that they will cover the regular Adderall for $10  but instead of charging $10 as they had before now charge $265 for the RX.  RX is great. All I can say about the regular Adderall is that is better than nothing  but not by much. Please note that both drugs are generic.

I took half in the morning & half at lunch & they really helped me get through the week. My wife said i was so much nicer 2 be around & i was able 2 function & complete tasks that i wasn't normally able 2 complete. I hope my friend is able 2 give me more or i can find a doctor 2 explain my experience w/to possibly give me my own prescription.
Julie,2/18/2010 21:46,(3-6),Female,Caregiver,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,4,4,My 5 year old daughter started taking Adderall one month ago.  While her school performace has improved greatly as well as her ability to complete her homework  when the med wears off in the evening  she becomes irritable  moody and beligerant with us.  We will be considering a different medicine for her.
,2/17/2010 13:54,(7-12),Male,Caregiver,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,14,My son is in 4th grade & had extreme difficulties at school such as focus comprehension accumulating info  disorganized not being able to finish the work in class  math  etc. He was also diagnosed a couple of years ago with DAMP. He was on Ritalin for a couple of months 2 yrs ago & stopped since we did not see any improvement. we were at the point of desperation & had enough frustrations & so did he!Therefore eventhough I was very much against drugs we decided that he needs help so let's give it another try! His dr. prescribed Adderall 10mg/day in the AM before breakfast- a miracle has been brought upon my son & our family!! it works wonderful  amazing! the only side affects that I noticed are the loss of appetite (which I am not too upset over since he is about 6 lbs. overweight & noticed that he is hungry in AM  so I give him a healthy breakfast) and sensitivity (he easily cries if someone gets him upset).Other than that there have been no other side affects. we are all extremely happy to see him do extremely well at school. He was never hyper  but had some behavior problems - even that has changed for the better.  He interacts & socialized better w/friends. Prior to this med his grades were Cs and Ds; ever since he started on Adderall the test results are amazing; A's in social studies and B+ in math!!  Not only that it makes everyone happy (his family as well as teachers)that he's doing so well but he is very well aware of it & I can see the happiness that he did not have before when he comes home with good grades & ease at learning!! He has built confidence & holds his head up high!! Thank you Dr. Weidner!!!...& of course Adderall!  I shall return & review this med in a couple of month & let everyone know if he's still doing just as well and/or if the side affects have changed!
a3gill,2/13/2010 23:11,(25-34),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,21,"Adderall has been a lifesaver. I took Ritalin as a kid and developed some nervous ticks. So  I dropped it  and tried to manage without. I did fine until college reading emerged.

I have a ridiculously high dosage  but it works great for me  other than nasty looks that I get from Pharmacists thinking that I am a dealer.(that buys inventory with insurance...LOL) My dosage is steady now  but for about the first year  it was increased each month. Thats probably just me though  my body doesnt respond well to medicine.

Reading comprehension has always been my biggest hurdle  non-technical reading is virtually impossible for me. Just below reading is hanging-in with poor lecturers. I need to have genuine interest in something or my mind will promptly begin to wander. If a teacher shows the end goal and it appears interesting  then the uninteresting stepping stones become interesting  because they are required to get to the concept that you want to know. Conversely  if a teacher presents each building block as something to know  ""because I said so "" then I will be staring out the window before they finish their sentence.

Since arriving at the correct dosage  I can now do anything that I want. Not only are my problem areas fixed  but other aspects have improved as well. The best way that I can describe it is having a librarian roaming around in your brain. My capacity for learning has gone off the charts  my memory retention and recollection is ridiculous  and the boost of energy really shines though in self-motivation. And  above all  I now spend at least 2-4 hours per day reading anything that I want.

To put my improvement in context  I took my ACTs un-medicated. My best score was a 29/36.
Hmm  its okay  but look at the pieces"

Time flies by extremely fast when taking this drug.  I'm on 20mg twice a day and take my first does at about 12pm and my second at about 6pm right before I go to work.  I am very careful not to increase my dose and use only the recommended amount prescribed by my doctor. I've been able to eat and sleep pretty much the same on this drug although my appetite has decrease somewhat and I've lost weight due to being able to focus more on the healthy things to eat as opposed to not eating at all.

Cass,1/28/2010 20:24,(35-44),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,5,5,5,14,I was VERY concerned about medicating behaviors  since I don't even take aspirin.  I have had GREAT difficulty with severe fatigue and ADD for years  and could not seem to work my way out of it. I tried to put systems into place  but I was never able to keep them going so they could work for ANY amount of time.   NOW I can FINALLY complete tasks in a timely fashion  organize and order my work and life and enjoy relationships  both personal and professional  as well as attend to details.  I am also able to resist the urge to hoard.  My life was chaotic with crap everywhere  piles and junk all over the place and disorganized messes abounding and overtaking me and my family.  The ability to function with a clear head and focus has completely changed ALL of that.  Thank the LORD I had a clinician who properly identified and prescriptively managed my SERIOUS problem of ADD with 10 mg of Adderall  twice a day.  I have been stable for over two years now.  The change is dramatic. Definitely life changing.

It calms me and allows me to focus and not be overwhelmed with regular tasks like housekeeping and managing my finances. I don't feel that I'm unable to do what I need and want to do. I understand my behaviors of unfinished school work  disorganization of my school work and notebooks  putting things off and most notable to me  my problems with math  in that I would simply miss or not ""see"" parts of problems  even when I understood a process of doing a problem."

If I didn't have ADD  I would be a hyper buzzing bee.  As far as its effectiveness  not sure yet  still to soon  I am titrating up right now to figure my correct dose.

The Dr switched me over to a generic Ritalin to help save cost but taking this has made me more ""hyped"" up than focused."

I was recently hospitalized with coronary artery spasms which resulted in slight heart attack.  I am concerned that the adderall caused this.  I was afraid to tell my family doctor that my psychiatrist prescribed this b/c I know his reaction would not be favorable.  Has anyone ever heard of adderall causing heart spasms?  Just in case  I have quit taking it since discharged but I do miss the energy and focus it gave me.

I abused it to the point that my boyfriend left me and I now suffer chest pain.  It has psycotic effects and can be life changing.  It should be taken off the market. It is worse than cocaine.  I can attest to that personally.
Rocco,12/15/2009 15:51,(19-24),Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5,5,5,4,Adderall has been an extremely effective drug for managing my ADD symptoms. Before being started on adderall  I found it difficult if not impossible to stay focused on most tasks  especially if the task was not something that i was interested in doing. With the medication however  I find it much easier to keep my mind on topic  allowing me to utilize my time and energy with much more efficiency and efficacy. My biggest complaint with adderall has been its effect on sleep. However  I found that if I take my last dose at least 9 hours before I intend to sleep it causes little to no problem.

Not only is this medication helping me get things done around the house and in school  it gives me the energy and motivation I need to get out of bed and take on the day. I also struggle with anxiety  depression  and have a horrible avoidance problem. This medication helps tremendously with those problems as well. I've also struggled with a weight problem  and this medication is helping me lose weight. I have a more positive outlook on things while on this medication.

Well I didn't know what a powerful addictive drug this was for someone who literally doesn't have typical add. Although when I take the quizzes I meet all the requiremnts except childhood was perfect. I now am trying to get off them and I must admit it is hard. I feel lethargic. But I am now starting Oriental medicine/Acupunture and it is helping with so many of my medical problems it's amazing. I get prescribed the adderoll by my psych but believe deep down I don't need it and am going to have to try my hardest to get off it. Get a 2nd opinion b4 you start on such a addictive med IMO

This is the one!  His behavior has changed for the better drastically since he started taking 10mg every morning before school!  He's doing so much better in school and is far more motivated than in the past.  I know it's early  but his teacher and I are very excited about his improvements.  After reading some of the other reviews and speaking with his doctor.  I have decided to NOT give it to him on the weekends and during school vacations.  Side effects have been less sleeping and no real appetite while he's at school.  He does however eat well in the evenings.

I did not stop consuming caffeninated products and that was a big no-no. It made my chest hurt. So I cut back for awhile. I have noticed that by lunch time the medicines effectiness has worn off. So the DR has told me to take the 20mg in morning and to take 10mg at lunch time. It is enough to get me through the day at work. I can be productive and complete my tasks. I have noticed though if I miss a dose I ge a bad headache
missjamiemarie,11/16/2009 21:22,(25-34),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,5,6,Well first of all I was not have to begin this medication at the age of 32. I have just started this medication. I have already experienced nausea  it was bad this morning and I couldn't even eat and didn't even feel like I could swallow. I almost vomitted and the feeling was awful. I had eaten about 6 hours earlier and hadn't had any of the drug in about 12 hours. I've had headaches and the jitters. They say this will pass. I'm trying to keep hydrated and take my vitamins. I'm only on the 5mg dose and have to bump up to the 10mg dose after 15 days  and I'm worried about further side effects. I know there are ADD drugs that are non-narcotic and plan to ask my psychiatrist about that option. On a good note it has begun to control my irritability and my impulsiveness (I'm known to intetrrupt and not be able to wait my turn to speak or not filter my thoughts and just blurt out thoughts) I do not have ADHD  I believe I have simple ADD and it runs in the family. Luckily my daughter doesn't seem to have many symptoms and does well in school. I just hope that the increase in dose does not give me too many side effects and I am worried that my tabacco use may increase my chance of a cardiac event. I do not like the feeling of my heart racing. I'm also taking an SSRI and worried about those side effects  my MD is aware. I'm just worried in general.

Happy Mom,11/12/2009 18:29,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,17,"I was diagnosed at a very early age (nursery school) and my parents were against any medication to deal with the problem. They instead sent me to a private school with smaller classes and kept having me tested throughout my school years and kept getting the same answers. I would not pay attention in class and was very disruptive. They would yelled at me after meetings with my teachers and ground me. It was not my fault. As I matured I was able to graduate from college but I had a very hard time focusing. I have been on Adderol and Vivanse for about a year now and I cant believe my parents put me through a miserable childhood when I could have been much more ""normal"" and been able to focus with the medication. I have not experienced any bad side effects from either meds and I am much more happy and less stressed."

At first  it would make him drowsey in the morning  he'd take a nap  then seemed less defiant for awhile  then he would crash and come down and have like these meltdowns late afternoon.  Today  however  was another story.  Doesn't make him tired anymore  instead it was like hearing and watching a robot
itsmesarahx14,11/8/2009 12:07,(13-18),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,2,5,I'm 16 now and i take 40 mg of Vyvanse everyday  but i started out on Adderall. It did its job and my grades shot up  but i was not myself at all! i was really really quiet and really shy (i'm extremely outgoing and always the life of the party so this was really really weird!) and another thing i didn't like about it was that i gained weight. Not to mention since Adderall is well known with people my age everyone was begging me to sell it once midterms and final exams came around. I mean i know other people who it's worked for  but it just wasn't for me.
NikiM1973,11/7/2009 18:31,(35-44),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,34,Since taking Adderall I consistently do the right things at the right time. Before Adderall I struggled with moments of genius followed by days of a mixture of procrastination and chaos. With Adderall my focusing abilities are quite amazing. I have to actually be careful to not over-focus. I can honestly get so hooked on the details of a particular work project that I find myself working for 12+ hours without much of a break. So with that said I should probably urge everyone to try to maintain a life of balance. I've always been good at what I do  but now I can do more with less. I eat less. I sleep less. I waste time less. I make mistakes less. I'm more patient. I'm overall much happier. Am I addicted to it? Yes. When I don't take it I'm an even bigger disaster than before. If I don't take it I could stay in bed all day and stare at the TV. For me  the Adderall PROS outweight the CONS. If you are a distracted mess with piles of papers  a racing mind  and an inability to put first things first then I suggest you talk with your doctor about trying a low dose for starters. I've been taking Adderall for about 4 years and I take 40 mg daily  in the form of two (2) 20mg tablets. I do not like the XR (extended release) formulation of any medication  so it is not specific to Adderall.
NEPABelle,11/7/2009 16:08,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,3,17,"I started Adderall when I was 20.Up to that point I had been on everything under the sun for my ADD since primary school - from Ritalin to antianxiety meds like Xanax  and every antidepressant inbetween. After trying so many of the 'popular' drugs  my psych. decided that we should try Adderall -I was a little unnerved about the drug after reading all of the negative things about it online but decided that  as a last resort  I'd give it a try.
I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER! This month is my 15th on the drug  and I've only noticed minor  appetite related side effects. [Perhaps it's because I am on a lower dose (20mg every morning and one 10mg at noon)?] Over all  I've noticed my focus is so much better  along with my ability to finish the things I start. My mind isn't going  going  going all the time  and I was finally able to get a job  and go back to school!  
I understand the concern with younger children taking this medication  however  everyone reacts differently to different things  and if there were any natural alternative that would work  I'd be the first one on it. [I had tried going off of it and went right back to not being able to sit still for more than 15mins.] From my experience with Adderall  I've realised that sometimes  some perscriptions are necessary to lead a normal  quiet life.
I know that the results aren't the same for everyone on it  but I did want to share a positive outcome"

ADDgirl,11/4/2009 16:19,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,4,4,5,3,"I have ADD and probably have been since a least a pre-teen[self-diagnosis] but haven't been professionally diagnosed until 3 months ago at age 33.  I am currently on 25mg of Adderall  1 pill daily in AM.  The 10mg & 20mg did nothing for me in terms of concentration but I am noticing better results with the 25mg  though I think it needs to be upped.  Only one time I was up 32 straight hours but that was partially due to having to be in school that night as well as the first increase from 20mg - 25mg. I had problems sleeping before taking this drug and I still do  though I CAN sleep through the night. I have experienced weight loss and lack of appetite with sometimes being repulsed by food.  I crave more water now.  This hasn't been a problem since I am obese  and I have lost almost 20 lbs in 3 months.  I no longer crave a lot of junk foods and eat more healthy since snacking isn't as frequent.  My job tasks and school work have greatly improved!  I wish my mom wouldn't have just told me to apply myself better in school and actually had me evaluated.  I don't feel like a failure anymore with this new outlook and I am finally at peace knowing about this ""disability""."

I took it for less than a week and felt jitterty. I opted to not take it on the weekends and on Saturday I could not get out of bed.  I thought to myself that if I took an adderol I would have the energy to get up that is when I knew I had to stop.  I have no desire to develop any kind of an addiction.

We saw very little improvement even when the doses were upped. Then they both got side effects  one was doing strange things with his mouth and the other was constantly picking his head(his teacher sent him to the nurse to check for lice cuz it got so bad) Last Monday the dr. switched to adderall xr 10mg the one who was having the mouth movements has improved alot! The other one stopped picking his head but started something new. He's CONSTANTY sniffling. He says he feels like he has no control of it. He's going to the dr. on Thursday so I hope we find something that works!!
,10/26/2009 7:06,(19-24),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,4,4,23,I am 22 and i have been on adderall since i was 14. This drug is insanely addictive and thats what I hate about it. Sure it works  makes you focus  you can go without sleep easier then others  it makes you lose weight (i myself lost 55 pounds)  and it makes you more sociable with others. But the price you pay is that you become dependent on it. Why would you want a drug to do all the work for you? It's going to cause health problems  most likely cardiac  if not now  in the future. You'll have to stay on it forever (my doctor literally said that i would have to take it forever  im not kidding)  and if you find it in yourself to quit  you'll hate the world when you go off of it. i tried to quit 4 years ago  got off of it for a year  and i couldn't take it  i had to get back on it. In my eyes  people do cocaine or meth for reasons similar to adderall. They need to stay up and get things done  feel happy  and they are addicted. Don't get on it. Learn to focus the old fashioned way. Because you'll still get that diploma  or certification  or acheive happiness and at the end of it all  you wont feel like you cheated or owe it all to adderall  you'll just be proud of yourself and have no dependencies. Thats soo much better and I really wish my parents would have just given me that option. Oh and one more thing  females have to get off of it when you get pregnant and thats scary to go through withdrawls and then go and be pregnant.

I hve not experienced the physiologic side effects  but i do notice i am not eating as much  but probably because I am not as bored so often.  I do believe that it has helped me quit smoking.   Immediately after begining this medication  I went from smoking almost a pack a day to two  just purely out of habit.  It keeps me so focused  I am not looking for any chance I can get to take a break.   The only undesirabe effect I have had is trouble sleeping.   I went from sleeping 10 hours a night to about 4 in a matter of two weeks.  This really has been a miracle drug  and I wish I would have been prescribed this when I was in high school and college.   It makes me kind of wonder what I would have really been able to acheive.

D.A.R.E.,10/19/2009 4:49,(25-34),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,4,3,12,At first the medication worked well. Work was easy  life was easy. After second month started having trouble sleeping. Eventually became an INSOMNIAC. I probably only slept around 4 hours a day. The medication also cause my skin to dry up. My scalp became itchy all the time and caused dandruff. My penis also became smaller and the skin around the head became dry and irratated. The medication caused my sex drive to decrease. Sex became painful and I felt a burning sensation upon ejaculation. I experienced severe cotton mouth as well. I stopped taking the medication and my appetite soon came back. The medication was addictive and when i got off of it  life was extremely difficult at first. I was tired ALL the time. I felt extreme exhaustion for the first week. My advice  stick to coffee and learn to pay attention.

I have suffered my whole life with ADHD/ADD.  I never knew or understood why I behaived the way I did  until my son showed the same symptoms and was diagnosed.  I asked my doctor about my symptoms and he recommended a low 20mg a day dosage.  I did not sleep for 3 days  I thought my heart would burst  but in three days  I read 4 books  all 400+ pages.
At work  my productivity increased instantly. Instead of looking for the door  and at the clock  ""bouncing off the walls"" as my co-workers would tell me  I was focused  task orriented  and results driven.  My district VP  who I have known for over 10 years  even called and asked me  why my team is doing so well.  I have been on this drug for 6 months now  and it has helped me to change my life! I have my blood pressure checked regularly  I excercise more  because I can focus and not get bored out of my mind in 3 minutes  I eat better  because I can read labels and know what it is I am eating  because my mind is not changing thoughts every 2 seconds and I forget what the HELL I was reading to begin with  my wife LOVES ME  because I am focused when she talks to me and I can actually carry a conversation with her  because I can remember what she just said.  And you know what else  I actually sat down and wrote this message in just a few minutes.  I did not even get up  or even think about anything else  I did not have to stretch  scratch  move  fidget  adjust  look around  yawn  cough  or ANYTHING  because this drug helped me. I thanked my doctor  and I cried when I did  because I have awakened  my mind does not race  and after 38 years of life  my mind is clear."

I have been on adderall for 6 months 15 mg twice a day. Bad thing is that after 3-4 hours I'm so tired and need to drink anything to pickj me up. I do not like the XR as it makes me too jumpy in the first 2 hours.
 I plan to increase my dosage but dread the side affects.

,10/1/2009 9:31,(35-44),Female,None,None,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,4,3,27,I am 38 yr old mother of two. My experience is the time release(XR) is the best form the non time release feels like you are on a roller coaster.  The time release is very smooth.  Although I started on 20mg I believe after 5 years on this and now down to 5mg a day this is a very hard drug on my body as a women.  I have two best friends on it and although we love the weight it keeps off and how organized we think we are on it we all believe there is a dark side to this drug that no one talks about. Everyone seems OK in our lives except our husbands.  There is an edgy/anger piece that goes along with this drug..  I think it effects our hormones in some way.  My suggestion is start on a lower dose and move up but I am looking for more natural choices because I think this drug makes life go by very quickly.  I also think as a women you can not help but get addicted to the way you burn more calories and it automaticly suppresses your appetite.  If you are on this and are having relationship problems then you might want to look at this drug as a reason and not other outside things. Also I think if you take the wrong dose it can actually make it harder to complete some things. This drug is in the same family as Meth amphedemines.  If you take this drug you should really think about the similarities to being a junkie!! I stopped taking it for 6 months and gained 30 pounds and I started sleeping a lot and my house became a disaster.  There is probably something better out there  but I have not found it.

,9/26/2009 11:16,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,4,5,42,"It works  it really does. Unfortunately  I became HIGHLY ADDICTED to this medication. I am 21 and a university student and have been on adderall since i was 19. In just two years i developed a 100mg+ habit per day  ended up literally going crazy  cutting  attempting suicide  committed to a psychiatric hospital  and then drug and alcohol rehab. Since I kicked adderall  I have been just fine. Kids won't tell you anything is wrong  because it makes them feel so good they want it more. It severely disrupts eating habits (I lost 35lbs  and as a 5'2"" female  that's a lot)  sleeping habits  and overall mood. I also found a sharp decline in imagination and overall creativity. Irritability  dehydration  diarrhea  malnutrition  anemia  and withdrawals were part of my adderall use that was prescribed by a psychiatrist for ADHD. 
PLEASE  if you are a parent wondering if your kid should be on adderall (which is an amphetamine salt  which is the single purest form of SPEED)  think again. Is it worth it in the long run? It is SPEED that you're messing with here- incredibly serious drug. There are many many more behavioral modifications that can be taught that are much more effective  and MUCH MUCH less detrimental to overall mental and physical health. 
NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I am faced with the daily decision of taking it and being able to focus but risk getting the debilitating headache or not taking it and being completely clueless about what my professor just said.  I have begun taking nsaids on a regular basis to counter the headaches.  If I were to decribe the headache it is a sinus like pain that starts around my eyes and is usually limited to one side of my head.  The length of time I have been taking it could be a factor but a headache is listed as a side-effect.

I felt no differently than I did before  no improvement or side effects or anything. . . Can anyone advise me why some people have NO reaction?  I will ask my doctor but wonder if any others have heard of such a thing.
GEElo,9/18/2009 12:05,(25-34),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,3,10,Taking Adderall XR with suboxone makes a pill cocktail. The high from those two drugs combined is a whole new ball game. First of all Docs know nothing but to see you on your appointment and then get rid of you. If they payed any attention they would know that a person with a history of drug or alcohol abuse should not take adderall or adderall xr. But then again they keep us coming back for business. So  would that make them a legal drug dealer. Yes  it would. I had a chemical dependency to perscription painkillers. I realized something was really bad when I was taking them just to be able to function from day to day. I sought help because things were all jacked up. If I could make a difference in someone's life just by writing this little piece then all the pain I caused myself and everyone around me  then I would have to say it was worth it. If you have a chemical dependency the first thing you do is decide weather or not you want to continue that way of life  which is extremely painful. Second  commit to yourself in getting well. You will need a really good support system to help you through it. With hard work and dedication to yourself you will succeed. If you follow those three rules you will get through it with out a dought. If I had to go through it again I would have gone to the psychiatrist to get on suboxone so I could wing myself through it. I was on suboxone for one year exactly. If I would have just listened to my brother and not got on the suboxone I would have gotten over the emotional withdrawl after about 5 to 7 days. The physical withdrawls(tiredness unmotivated)would eventually pass around three to four weeks. So  you could get through it in a months time verses getting on suboxone and wasting a year of your life.

lil&#39;learner,9/10/2009 12:44,(25-34),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,18,I've struggled with ADD my entire life but my parents were totally against medicating me (thank you mom and dad) Instead they made an effort to get me help from tutors and personal coaches that taught me good organizational and study habits which helped a bit. I struggled all through out my 6 years of college and now at 26  moving into the ranks of working for myself and taking on several projects  I could really use some help. My buddy gave me some adderall and I probably got more work done in 2 weeks than my 6 years of college- mainly because I neither ate nor slept for days at time. I also found that I was able to pop these like skittles with frightening ease. I couldn't see taking this medication daily as I wouldn't risk my physical and psychological well-being for any amount of work or money. I believe this should be used as a last resort. One thing I have learned is to observe my work habits while on adderall vs. when I'm not and try to mimic those behaviors daily. This drug is certainly a tool for success but I feel that it shouldn't be used as a way of living.

It helped a little but not enough to cause me to really follow a treatment track with enthusiasm...typical ADD. Anyway  I am now 46; I have had 4 different employers in that time  plenty of stress  depression  anxiety  low self esteem  etc. Three years ago  I had the double sleep study which revealed that I have narcolepsy. So now  my sleep specialist has me taking 30mg XR in the morning  and Adderall tabs of 20mg at 9am/noon/3pm for a total of 90mg/day. I have gone through highs and lows with this drug - more highs than lows. I think that the biggest drag in this whole process is that Adderall is just a daytime life support system for my exhaustion; it does enable me to focus  hustle  retain instructions  etc. But - I still have an incurable sleep disorder which never allows me to get restorative sleep. I am definitely addicted to Adderall; I get anxious when my doctor goes on vacation because he has done it in the past  without notice! Needless to say  I am changing doctors. Finally  I can relate to people that complain about the zombie effect. I have a great ability to entertain my family and friends with my humor  and sometimes it will just disappear for days. My new doctor said that he is worried about my heart; I told him that I am at peace with ""death by heart attack"". He was not amused. I wasn't trying to be funny  just pragmatic. I need my Adderall and I think it works great for the right patient."

I got pregnant at 17 and was taken off all my meds. The doc told me that I would outgrow the ADD and probably wouldn't need to be put back on it after I had the baby. After a long 5 year struggle with the same problems I had as a child  my dr. decided to try me on straterra. I tryed it for 4 weeks as he suggested  and the only thing it did for me was drain my bank account. We tried several diffrent drugs  including the same one I took during childhood/adolesence without finding one that provided desired results. I was about to give up hope when the doctor decided to try adderall. A God send! I am now able to think clearly  something I haven't done in a while. I can concentrate  focus  and stay on task now. It helped me to be able to stay organized  and helped the constant aggrivation I suffered with. Thanks to this wonderful drug I no longer feel as if I am at war with my thoughts  I finally have some much needed relief from my mind.

My teachers have actually came up to me and asked if I  was the same person who was in their clas a week ago.  It has helped me get through fourth through sixth grade.  The only problem I have is that it made me want to do evreything at once and that really stressed me out.  I got mild depression becuase of that and I'm now taking an antidepressant AND Adderall.  It's kind of hard to remember to take both the drugs and I somtimes miss a few day on one or both of the drugs.  This drug worked on me but please find out exactly what it does to you before making a comitment to taking it.  Ask your doctor if you can start on the lowest dosage possible and graduly work your way up untill you find a dosage right for you.  Like any other medication it is a hit or miss and you should stop taking it if it worsens your condition or if you have side effects lasting longer than two weeks.  I hope my information helped!

Our family doctor decided it would help him concentrate in college.  Immediately I noticed that a generally tender-hearted goodnatured young man became cruel  moody and for lack of a better definition psychotic.  He started abusing alcohol  risky sexual behavior  and would lie about anything.  It was like a alien had taken over my son's body.  It has been a nightmare and I would never encourage any parent to give this drug to their children.  My son has been off of it for about 1 week and right now he is a fragile shell who has suffered with depression  vomiting  headaches etc.  My hope for his once bright future now rests on his ability to overcome an apparent addiction and not to be drawn back down that road.  This is not anything you want to put into your body.  I feel like my only son has been taken from me and I don't know if I will ever get that same bright eyed  enthusiatic young man back.

This worked well for me until after a year I realized that there was a connection between by bedtime asthma attacks.  After a year of treatment found the connection and stopped right away....sure enough the same week my asthma attacks at bedtime stopped.  Breathing is pretty important to me...hence med change.

missy,7/18/2009 13:22,(55-64),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5,5,5,2,When my daughter found this so helpful in school I tried one and really found myself staying on task.  I talked with my doc and he put me on  20mg.  I have been amazed at how I forget to eat and it does not affect my daugter this way and she takes 30mg.  Combined with lo dose prozac has actually helped more than all the strong antidipressants I have tried.  Can't take too late in the day and does sometimes cause me to wake in middle of night.
,7/17/2009 19:37,(19-24),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,22,I am a college student and have been started taking Adderall because I have been on a downward slope academically since my freshman year of high school to now. Although I have had problems with paying attention  getting started with projects  etc.  I was able to get by. The work in school  naturally  has become harder. I have been a B/C student for awhile now. For the last month  I have yet receive any assignment that is less than an A. Menatlly  this drug has helped. Physically  not so much. I have noticed that I am more hyperactive. I am constantly fidgeting with my hands and my legs are shake profusely. Also  my eating habits are terrible. I was at a slim 135 pounds to begin with before I began the medication and I know for a fact that I will have lost weight the next time I see my doctor. One side effect is loss of appetite. This effect is extremly noticeable. For me  I very very rarely feel hungry. Just last week I forgot to eat ANYTHING for two straight days. Overall though  if you are careful and responsible this is an effective and easy-to-use drug. Hopefully  this helps.

I started on 30mg once daily now after two months I moved up to 30mg in the morning then another one in the afternoon. These are the time release one's and they work real good.

It does help me focus. I started taking adderall 6yrs ago in college  cause hated ritalin(doesn't work for me  just gives me insomnia)  starting at 10mg and quicly going to 30mg  it's starting to wear off. Time release doesn't work  I'm on 30mg now and the wanted affects wear of after about 3hrs. Then i'm still left with the unwated side affects; like INSOMNIA  drymouth  and nausea. Like I said thou  adderall does work great and does what its ment to do.
Jess,6/23/2009 17:16,(25-34),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,8,I've been diagnosed with ADHD since age 6  I am now 26 years old.  I'm overall satisfied with this medication.  I noticed that my mood seems to be more even  I have a better handle on my disorder versus the other medications I've taken  and most of my other symptoms are under control.  I have noticed weight loss but my doctor told me before hand that it would happen. Being that I gained some weight after I stopped my previous medication  I didn't mind that too much.  I have also noticed more dry-mouth than my other medications so I'm drinking a lot more water through the day  but I don't mind that so much as I drink a good amount of water anyway.  One thing that I will have to say is that I keep having to 'readjust.'  My doctor  who I love  started me on an extreme low dose and is working me up to my 'stable' point which has spanned over 8 months now.  Getting to the point of 'stable' is my biggest issue since precautions have to be taken. Due to the nature of this drug  that the risk of addiction is high  my doctor and I are taking it slow.
,6/23/2009 16:11,(19-24),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,17,I have been taking adderall 20mg once a day and this drug is very affective in treating my ADHD.  I explained that I have a very hard time concentrating.  Whether face to face conversations  reading  or in meetings it was very difficult to give my undivided attention to someone or a group. Additionally  I have struggled for a long time in school  college especially and thought it was just lack of sleep. However  both of my brothers have ADHD and after talking to my doctor about my condition he recommended adderall 20mg.  I was jittery at first (simular to too much caffine) but now Im getting used to it.  I now do not crash everyday after work and no longer need my afternoon nap.  I also can focus on conversations and remeber things much better.  It enables me to be more productive and I can get much more stuff done than before.  It does curve my appetite too so make sure if you take this med. to eat as you did before.

,6/17/2009 12:08,(13-18),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,5,5,29,i am a 16 year old. I started taking adderall at the age of twelve. When i was on the drug it was very effective. It helped me concentrate in school  calmed me down from acting out  and helped prevent me from doing bad things. Although it has done good  it has also done bad. For example  i started losing weight because i never had an appetite  i became more distant with people because i was quiet all the time from focusing on things  and i also became needy of it all the time. I have been off of the pills for about a year now and I'm doing just fine. It is extremely hard to get out of the habit of needing them. It takes time to get out of the habit  but eventually it will work. Trust me.  Adderall can be very addictive and although it can benefit you  it may also destroy you in some ways. So one tip to take into consideration if you want to start taking adderall is to start off at a low dosage and work your way up until you feel it is doing its job.

I was diagnosed with ADD as a child  but I not took the medication.  I am 35 now and am a small business owner.  I was making small  little stupid mistakes that I just easily overlooked.  My Dr. started me off with 30mg twice a day. I have seen these reviews and have yet to see someone taking that much.  I had all of the the effects for about a month and then they all eventually went away.  The drug overall has improved my attention disorder and even made me more productive.  It allowed all of my energy to be creative.  I still use it today at the same dosage but I found it better for me to take 60mg in the morning and let it run its course through the day.  If you do need to take it. Remember that every ones body responds differently to medication.  I suggest to experiment the time gaps in the beginning and see what best responds to your body.  You will become addicted to it after a while  no choice in that  but just use your months supply evenly.  It has been a success and I researched this med.. I accept the cons of this medication  but for me ""someone who really needs it"" the pros weigh out the cons.  it has made me more productive with my life and for my family responsibilities. If you ""REALLY"" are not diagnosed by a physician. Please remember that you will get a reverse effect and it will be equivalent to taking cocaine.  But for those who need it it will have a reverse effect and make you more focused and in a clear state of mind  without the million things around you distracting you from your realistic goal.
Good Luck and Be Wise! Parents  Be alert of your kid on this if applicable  it is becoming a known street DRUG for abuse. Thanks!"

,6/8/2009 22:35,,,None,None,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,3,1,15,I am junior in high school and have been taking adderall for 3 years. At first it seemed like a miracle drug. My grades went up considerably and I felt that I had gained a sense of control. I was prescribed 30mg a day including one 20mg pill of adderall xr. The side effects were harsh in the beginning and I lost a lot of weight. The next 2 years I would take it regularly still having the same side effects but very mild. In short  I could go off the pill and feel fine for any amount of time. But I began to feel a sort of dependence on the drug about a year after. The loss of appetite seemed to be a motivation for me to be thin so i started to up my dose a little bit. My grades went from a 3.3 to a 2.7 and so i figured I was immune to the drug so I started to take even more. For the past about 6 months I have regularly been taking at the least 50mg and at most 70mg a day. Sometimes I don't know why I am taking it I just do. I can honestly say in the past week I have slept in total maybe 10-15 hours some nights not sleeping at all. My heart is constantly pounding and my hands are always shaking. I hate it but i can't help it. My parents dont hide my pills or anything and dont keep track of when they get it so it makes it easy for me.I am always very moody and today I had a nutri grain bar and thats it but I dont even feel hungry. I didnt think drugs prescribed to myself could be so addictive but they are. I suggest people not to take them to begin with.

I was started on 20mg of Adderall xr  then went to 25 mg xr  and now I take 25mg xr in the morning around 6am  and then an Adderall IR  10mg  around noon to one p.m.  I think Adderall works great  the problem I had was that even though it is an XR formulation it seemed to wear off around noonish everyday.  I was never able to get ""all day coverage"".  In February my doctor added the 10mg IR ""booster"" and it has worked great ever since.  He told me that every one's body metabolism is different and some get longer coverage than others.  This is what worked for me.  I was worried about sleep issues being on this dose  the amazing thing is I actually feel like I sleep better since being on this medication.  When I lay down to go to sleep I don't have a million and one things floating through my head like I use to.  It's like the background ""white noise"" is gone.  My thoughts are so much clearer now and I can actually get things accomplished instead of 20 things half accomplished.  It's too bad people abuse this drug  it's makes it more difficult for people who use it for legitimate medical purposes to get it.  All of my other medications I can get a 90 day supply in the mail.  With Adderall I have to go to my doctors office every month and pick up my prescription in person.  Other than that absolutely no complaints.  Good luck to all."

attention deficit. The medication works well for him  I have been keeping in touch with his teacher  and she said that he does well in class.

I work full time and am in graduate school.  I also train significantly (20+ hours weekly) for 10K races and triathlons.  So to put it lightly  I am a busy bee.

JustSomeThoughts,5/20/2009 11:15,(25-34),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,5,5,16,Without a doubt this is an effective drug however it is powerful and has potentially serious side effects.  I've taken adderral for a few years now and it has been a tremendous study and work aid.  Those who take it must be careful due to the outright strength of this stuff.  For about a year I would say that I was addicted to adderral.  I would take too much  too often and get more from friends when I ran out.  During this time I had extreme mood swings  anxiety  loss of sexual interest ability  etc.  Plain and simple I was not myself at all.  I lost weight and I felt as if my personality changed.  After realizing the dilema I stopped taking it for a bit and got healthy.  Now I take the recommended dosage on the prescibed schedule.  It is effective and since I am aware of the side effects I make sure that I am eating right  sleeping enough  etc.  All and all it is an effective drug however those taking it should be very mindful of the possible downside.  Finally  I do not like most children should take this drug  and none should do so in high doses.  If children cannot do anything without the aid of medication  then they will be dependant on this stuff their whole like.  I still function and get work done in a demanding job with or without adderall.

I tried Adderall and I had a great experience. I felt focused  energized  driven  and over all very happy. I was thinking i might take 20mg dosage mon  wed  and fri. I feel it might decrease my risk of dependancy  decrease the amount of unneeded weightloss  and make me more driven (aside from my good grades i feel that its due to my ability to learn quickly  though i never pay attention and never really try hard in school) I want to pay attention i just cant. I would like some feedback on peoples thoughts. also i have no history of drug abuse  addiction  etc. I play sports and lead a very healthy lifestyle. I just don't feel driven.

Was working fine then began loosing focus again. Doctor increased the dosage to 20mg a day  half twice a day. Was working fine then I started to notice I wasn't focusing as well. I do not abuse the medication. So I thought I wold look up this medication on your site. What my medication looks like you have something of the complete opposite. I take the generic of Adderall. Mine is peach and it has 20mg on the back and the number and the letter of b 973 on the front. But your site said it should be dark orange. I noticed last week SOME of the pills were a little dark orange around the edge but not all of them. I also noticed that when I had my prescription filled just this past Sat. that the phyarmist typed on the bottle (20mg TABBRR) what is that suppost to mean. I also noticed that the medication usually takes several hours before I notice and difference as far as focusing that is. How do I know if I am recieving the right medication? I have my prescriptions filled at CVS.

I felt like information went into my brain but went right out the other side. I would read  listen to a lecture or be in a conversation and end with no recollection of the information I was given. How was I to explain this to a doctor... I thought they would think I was crazy. I rehearsed over and over what I would say to them to make them believe there truely was a problem. How much easier it would be to go in and show them a cut  bruise or broken bone... they could fix it. How could they diagnose or fix a problem they couldn't see and I couldn't explain. I spent 7 years in and out of the doctors office. She first put me on prozac  treated me for an inter-ear infection  had me get all of my old fillings replaced  got glasses treated me for allergies  etc. All these things were good but there was still something much more. She gave up  one day she said ""I can't help you"". Talk about a heart break and a validation that I was crazy. One day I read an ad on Straterra... explaining the symptoms of adult ADHD. I asked my doctor if there were special test for that. She said yes  as she rolled her eyes  but she would have to refer me to a shrink...here we ago again! 
The psycologist had me diagnosed in moments. No special tests were needed. The Straterra has helped for about 6 years now but there was still something more that I couldn't put my finger on. I have been going to doctors now for another 3 years to finally get one to take my extreme fatigue seriously. I took a sleep test and I have mild narcolepsy. My doctor has recently added adderall and I am finally content that what I have been silently struggling with all my life has been discovered and properly treated. I breaks my heart to pieces to think I raised my 3 children without this help. I struggled so badly just to make it through each day and hide my feelings of ""stupidness"". Now at almost 50  I feel like I have a clear mind...and a new start on life."

tm0826,4/21/2009 14:26,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,3,5,5,6,"I was prescribed adderall 10 mg bid for excessive daytime sleepiness last year/summer. It worked wonders for me. Kept me very alert more focused. Only side effects I had was a little shakey  mild high blood pressure but only when I first took it  and higher resting pulse rate. I also had lack of appetite which I thought was a plus. And weight loss. I lost my job and couldnt continue to take my adderall. I was back to my sleepy fatigue ways it was horrible. So I was dying to go back on the adderall plus I had gained about 30 lbs!!!So I have now been back on the adderall 10 mg bid and my side effects have gotten worse. I feel the med works like it did before but my b/p is high sometimes 150/100 and my resting pulse is 90-100. I sometimes get ""pangs"" of pain in my chest like 2-3 times a day and I have shortness of breath sometimes. Like I need to take a deep breath. It is making me nervous. I think my b/p was a little high before I started adderall so not sure if its directly the adderall.I do have loss of appetite again but have not lost any weight. Which sucks!! But I have only been on adderall for about a month. So maybe I just didnt lose it yet.When I first started taking the meds last summer I did sometimes take up to 40 mg in one day.I know Im not supposed to but I would if I wanted to study or get up early the next day. My fatigue/sleepiness gets so bad sometimes I physically cant get up in the morning. And sometimes I can sleep like a whole day. So maybe thats why I lost more weight  too. Has anyone else had these side effects that I am now having? I have an app. with my primary physician this week for the high b/p. Just to make sure all is ok. Im only 30 yrs old and dont want heart probs.now!! But I like the adderall and hope I can stay on it."

My dr. started me on 10 mg twice a day (she recommended 6-8 hours apart)for 2 days and just today I started taking 15 mg twice a day. And she may want to take me up to 20 mg twice a day depending how I am feeling. Just 5 day ago I was switched to generic Celexa (I take 10 mg twice a day for 1 week and then will increase to 20 mg twice a week) Rigt now I am not feeling too great....I have periods where I feel good and have energy  other times I am in the dumps and tired. Not really sure if this is the right meds for me....The jitteriness is bothering me mostly...anyone have any thoughts about this?

I take 20mg of prozac and 45mg of adderall spread out during the day. I was very happy with it at first.Its like i woke up completly for the first time in my life and got everything that i needed to get done accomplished. I have now noticed that I bruise easily  my limbs become numb and tingly occasionally and my circulation seems to be altered a little to where I have noticed it cant be good. My feet do swell and they turn purple if I apply a little pressure to them. My perception of objects seem to be a little off cause i run into everything. I also keep these lumps under my scalp? It seems to stay in the same top portion of my scalp and it just feels lumpy like theres fluid or something trapped in there. Would like to find out if anyone is experiencing the same things. It does wonderful keeping me from taking a nap everychance i get because i just cant go on but I am starting to wonder if it is worth it?
stepford41,4/15/2009 18:05,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,1,3,39,I have been chronically late most of my life so much so it has cost me jobs. Etc. I also was the kid who just looked out the window in grade school. My psych  decided to give me a test and bam  I have ADD. and was given the generic version. After reading these reviews  I can relate. I have horrible tirade mood swings  I don't feel like I am getting more work done during the day  I focus on things that are not a priority like ebay. I also leave the office so exhausted I feel like I have lost me. I have no energy to do anything. Errands are a big deal  working out  forget it. I feel like I have no time  because I waste a lot of it. Procrastinating. It is ruining my life. The only good thing is it keeps my hunger at bay  and my weight is at 120. I think I am taking more and more to keep awake during the day. What is so wonderful  your doc gives you this stuff  and no one tells you to watch for side effects. I wonder if I was off all these meds how I would be. I am 41 and feel like a 90 year old taking a bunch of pills each day. One to bring me up  one to bring me down  one for depression one for anxiety. I have never been one to lose patience  and I lose it all the time. I have ruined relationships because of it. I react  don't think.  I feel like I need rehab.

I am a high school teacher  an athlete and a father of a beautiful 5 year old autistic child.  As I learned about autism I saw there was a connection with ADD and I thought I had it.  Well I have always been very ant-meds but I was still very curious to try and see what meds could perhaps do for me.  My ADD symptoms have been fatigue  innattention  foggy thinking  procrastination to name a few.  For the last week I have been taking 10 mgf of Adderall twice daily.  Although I have only taken the medication for 5 days it has been really helping me tremendously.  I am calm and relaxed and I can comfortably sit still.  I have a lot more patience for my son and I feel better in general.  I think people should however be very careful with this medication and take it very carefully. For me this medication has (for the very short time I have tried it) been a huge help."
Garfila,4/6/2009 23:22,(25-34),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,4,5,5,3,This is a Reply to the woman who posted a question on 3/20/09.... Edema (Swelling/Fluid) in the ankles & feet is a seriouse side effect from Adderal and indicates a circulatory problem (blood flow) usually due to a heart problem. Most likely a temporary side effect but a serious one. If you stop taking the drug  symptoms should go away unless serious damage has been done or it's poss it could be related to another condition or a drug/food interaction with Adderall. Call your doctor/pharmacist. Also  Review drug info on WebMD.

teabird55,3/20/2009 0:43,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,4,5,5,9,I was prescribed Adderall for ADD without hyperactivity. I began with the XR but found that the dosage of 40mg was to much so I cut my dosage to 20mg.  I still felt like I was getting to much to quick  so I asked my doctor to precribe the regular 20mg generic which are scored so that I can break them in half and continue the meds at an even pace.  I have great focus at work  but by the time the day is finish I am so tired and washed out I have to rest.  This medication gives my brain the ability to focus perfectly however my energy level has not increased all that well. I eat less  but I've not lost weight and not that I'm looking to loose by taking this. I have notice a major problem with water retention and the swelling of my feet  ankles and hands. Almost like I am bloated.  I was wondering if anyone else was having any of these symtoms.  If you have please let me know.

I like the XR pills MUCH better than the fast acting pills  but can no longer afford them due to recently losing my job and health insurance. I used to take 25mg (XR) in the morning and that worked well  and I noticed less side effects.  Now I take 10mg of the generic amphetamine salts 2 x's a day. Since starting on the medication I have less difficulty prioritizing my day and schedule  retaining information  starting and finishing tasks  and paying attention in general. On the other hand  I have developed nervous habits I can't break like biting my lips  playing with my nails and a crazy desire to smoke  feel awkward in certain social situations (which is TOTALLY not me)  feel edgy and moody at the end of most days  and sometimes have trouble making fast decisions and conveying my thoughts clearly. Over all  I feel the benefits of the drug outweigh the negative side effects (I used to be a total spaz and be asked almost daily if I was ""on crack""  which really messed with my self esteem) so I continue to take it  but I cant help but wonder if I should try something else.

In the beginning he had shortness of breath and hot flashes. After a couple days he was dizzy and has an upset stomach. He did not eat very much. My son would focus more in school and be more calm but he developed anger issues  and he would yell at his parents and siblings which he hadn't done before. The littlest thing would annoy him  and at times he seemed depressed. Sometimes my son would say do I have to take my pill today.

melindanicole,2/5/2009 22:01,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,7,I was diagnosed with manic depression 2004..started wellbutrin xl 300mg until march 2008. I didn't feel as if i was depressed i just had a hard time starting finishing anything. Then the doctor diagnosed me with a.d.d. i've been taking adderall 10mg 2x daily for 5 weeks now and its amazing what a difference it has made. I do get a little edgy when i'm coming off of it but the pros completely out number the cons. The only thing i was wondering is that i get the chills while on it...i've asked others who take it and they never heard of it but i experience it. I do drink a lot of ice water when im taking it throughout the day but i've drank ice water before when i wasn't on it and never got chills. so i was j/w if anyone has experienced that?
LOLALOVE,2/5/2009 13:17,(19-24),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,2,20,I sought help when I found it nearly impossible to sit and concentrate on my school work. My mind was everywhere  I had no motivation to do the work  couldn't explain why. My ADHD is.. well  I am hyperactive just to the extent that I find I am always moving something  just slightly  for instance like wiggling my toes. I'm also the daydreamish type  which isn't easy in college. Benefits of Adderall  in my case  included more energy  increased focus  increased calm  and an increased ability to express what I had to say because my thoughts weren't as scattered. I could follow the teacher easier in class  things made much more sense.. it was as if my mind was on steroids or something. Like steroids  Adderall had its side effects too  which in my case included mood changes when it wore off (I heard Adderall XR prevents that  but haven't tried)  but I'm talking extreme irritability  and normally I am not like that at all.. so personality changes.. I kept to myself  felt my empathy leave  feelings and emotions numbed SIGNIFICANTLY. felt dead inside. Sure  I could concentrate on whatever I CHOSE  and I didn't magically want to do school work  that's the catch. If you're like me  you still have to make that conscious decision to do the work.. and once you do decide to  it is a heck of a lot easier to concentrate. If you start the doses do so slowly.. when I was on too high a dose  I felt so stressed  had high blood pressure  & I was angry  & too concentrated. Please consider trying other options first. I got off adderall  was tired for daysss  learned more about ADHD & more about myself.. & I don't have it all figured out but I feel alive & unaltered & like myself & EVERYONE can tell when the real me is showing.. having people who understand & love me the way I helps me want to care for myself better by eating better  sleeping earlier  exercising & relaxing more  & being alone  without distractions when I study. Be easy with yourself  DO NOT GIVE UP  you ARE NOT alone!
rpm702,2/4/2009 12:05,(35-44),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,5,5,5,20,I suffered from fatigue  depression and daytime sleepiness for 9 years.  In addition  I have severe generalized anxiety disorder.  I tried every anti-deppresant ever invented with no improvement.  Adderall 20 mg 2X a day works mircacles for me. No fatigue no anxiety no depression or daytime sleepiness. I tried Provigil which increased my anxiety.  Provigil is too $$$ and ineffective in my opinion.  I truely beleive that Adderall has many uses other than ADD/ADHD and Narcolepsy disorders.  Further research should be done to prove it.
anonymous :(,2/4/2009 4:05,(35-44),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,1,1,18,OMG...Where do I start? I almost died being on this drug. I had horrible heart palpitations  racing pulse  could not sleep (EVER)  OCD symptoms>>>I washed my hands about 50 times a day until they bled  aggressive behavior (I am not agressive nor was I ever until Adderall  I could not sit still for a minute  I had to be moving all the time  I had shortness of breath  I started grinding my teeth. When I first started this drug I was of average weight. As the months went on  I became skeletal. (Not attractive for those of you that abuse this drug for your own screwed-up purposes)Bottom line is I did a bang-up in school but ADDERALL ALMOST KILLED ME!!! (BTW the Dr. (aka hack) who prescribed this for me should have had his medical license revoked at the very least) He helped in what could have been my death by prescribing it improperly.  A good MD was visibly angry when he learned of the total incompetence of this guy. He could not believe the danger he had put me in concerning Adderall. Needless to say  I am doing MUCH BETTER now>>>alive  not dead (lol) So there is my NIGHTMARE of the SPEED they call ADDERALL. I even left out some gory details
,2/4/2009 3:45,(19-24),Female,None,None,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,12,"I feel like many doctors are prescribing far to high of a dosage of this medication to start. I am currently prescribed 30mg/day in 10mg tablets. I take one and a half before heading to my early classes  the other half approximately 5 hours later to get through my remaining classes  and am still able to come home and take a nap in the afternoon before taking the third one in the evening to study. Following this dosage I have never been shaky  dizzy  sleepless  or anything other than focused and happy.

I simply don't understand how a doctor could start someone at a dose of 30mg at a time twice a day. That's asking for a heart attack. I've thought about switching to the time release form but I like having the ability to modify how much I'm taking at each point in the day so I'm most productive."

KenK,1/29/2009 0:25,(35-44),,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,10,I have been on Adderall for many years. This drug has helped me very much. As a child no Dr. knew what I had. They thought I was just a very active child. That it would pass. When it did not pass they put me on Ritalin. Then after about the 6th. grade my father said it was all in my head. So he took me off of it. Until about 6 yrs. ago I went on Adderall. It has saved mylife. I can sit and talk to someone without getting up or asking over and over what they said. I can start and finish things. Yes I eat a little less but to me I do not care. I came from a time when there was no drugs not even a name for it. The Dr.s made my mother think she was a bad mother. So yes this drug can be used for bad. If not taken the right way. But for people like me its the answer to my problems.

jtabor31,1/21/2009 20:12,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,5,5,10,I have been taking Adderall 20mg 2x daily for the past year. My grades in college improved dramatically (I am now graduated) and I am very focused  accomplishing any task hand. This works great  however  if I am tired and I take this medication I will get lightheaded and have heart palpitations. I suggest not taking this medicine in the late afternoon or evening because it WILL prevent you from getting a good nights sleep. Other then those few down points  this drug has changed my life. If taken responsibly it does more good then harm. Please watch out for what I have experienced

I was on Vyvanse and I loved it. But  my doctor switched me for two months to see how it would do for the long days at school  work  home etc. Just bad bad bad. One  and the only good thing I can can about it is that it started working right away. Then  when it kicked into high gear it was all down hill.

I had no problem getting school work done  taking notes  taking tests  doing homework  paying attention at meetings  finishing all my jobs at work and keeping my room organized. It seemed to always do its job  but without ANY say was changed to another medication and seem to experience much anger  no appietiet  a feeling of numbness and get depressed at the end of the day. Aderall was the medication that worked for me  not Vyvance.

It works wonderful for the ADD symptoms. I was able to study and concentrate. However  the side effects are not worth it. I had insomnia  shortness of breath and increased heart rate. I felt like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest. I now deal with my ADD symptoms without medication and I'm a lot happier.

I'm on it  10mg per day and am so stoned and dissoriented I can hardly stand it. It did not help the ADD. I am having really strange thoughts  like the dog in a bowtie and tux  and laughing my butt off over anything. Tried to tell Health Plus I can't take amphetamines  Bureaucrats playing Doctors!
,1/8/2009 6:00,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,3,15,"I started taking Adderall XR a year ago  w/o a prescription.  I am in my last year of college and up until last year  I could never pay attention in class or study.  I started taking 20mg when I had to study  and instantly my grades improved.  I now take it whenever I have class to attend or when I am studying  which is between 2-4 times a week.    I start to feel it about 30-60 mins after I take it. If I'm tired  it wakes me up completely(I am never tired during its duration). It lasts about a total of 6 hours for me (female  110 pounds).
During these hours  I only desire to study and learn. In class  I am now very attentive and class goes by so much quicker for me.  In the past  I just daydream and can't stand sitting there for more than 1.5 hours.  Now  I can sit through a 5 hour class.  I also participate a lot in class now  it makes me want to show everyone how smart I am  haha.  However  when I am on it  I do not like people talking to me because all I want to do is study. People now always tell me how much of a nerd I am  which makes me feel really happy"

Above all i was so unorganized in thoughts and tasks. Adderall changed my life. Its not a drug that instantly makes you organized or extremely good in school  that is your part  it just gives you a boost and focus that you need  but without effort on your part things wont change that much. I have to say this medication does change one as a whole  in every aspect of life.
dawn,1/5/2009 1:38,(35-44),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Other,5,5,5,9,This drug is an excellent solution to the ADD I have  not with hyperactivity. The bad rap that these medicatios get due to the minority or those who abuse it is criminal. This drug and other medications of it's class are so difficult to get for those of us who do use it responsibly  the pharmacies do not want to carry it  due to cost or lack of need. The doctors are refusing to treat with it and rely on inadequate and ineffective subsitutions.

I had dislexia as a child  and when I was younger  if anyone in our family had a problem  it was to be kept a secret. I finally got help  and found out I have ADHD. I have been on this medication for 3 months now  and what a complete turnaround  talk about 360! I can focus more on important things  I even noticed a change in my driving  instead of running around like a chicken with its head cut off  I have slowed down and started enjoying things  and am much better at dealing with with problems instead of running away from them  I have also been writing a journal everyday  and remembering things alot better  and feel I am thinking before I open my mouth first. the only problem I have noticed lately  is that at night  I get a little edgy. other than that I love the fact that I feel like I am finally in control of all the racing things that used to go on in my head  and now I can sit back and relax for a change  and organize my priorities  whereas before I could not.

Is this something I should be worried about?

Adderall seems to work best with me. It helps my mood  keeps me at the keyboard longer without wandering around the internet and stuff and helps me take care of issues in life before they becomes tragedies. If you suffer from depression but do not like the effects of the SSRI drugs  give Adderall a try."

Photographer,12/15/2008 21:45,(35-44),,None,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,4,68,I am a successful nationally known professional advertising photographer who was on Adderall for about five years and then decided that I did not need it anymore because all of my old ADHD habits where mostly gone. I was off of them for about three months and all of those long gone adhd habits that had played havoc with my life started coming back one by one. Unpaid parking tickets  loosing my keys  rash decisions  unfinished project after unfinished project. Within six months I had almost lost my photography business that I had worked so hard for and had collections agencies after me etc.  Wow what a bust to my ego! I guess I really do need to be on Adderall. It's as if when I am not on Adderall I know exactly what it is I need to do to keep my life running smooth...I put together my to do list but the to do list never gets completed. Yes I am a successful advertising photographer with lots of talent...but without the discipline and focus to apply that talent my world falls apart. I guess I just need to take it...it is what it is. I know there are lots of talented artists who take adderall...and I do not feel it makes me any less creative....or for that matter any more creative. How one little adderall XR pill makes the difference between being reasonably disciplined and totally irresponsible  however  is beyond me...but for me the reality is just that. I am now back on Adderall 20 MG XR and things are going great again. Hope this was helpful to any other artists out there who are struggling with the to medicate/not to medicate question. In my case the choice was made for me...I do not even think I would still be in business without this drug..no kidding.

,11/27/2008 10:18,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,5,18,I have had ADHD  most likely since I was a young kid (I'm now 24)  but diagnosed a little over 1 year ago.  I recently finished graduate school  and stopped the Adderall since I stopped seeing the MD.  Now that I've been back on it (about 2 weeks) I'm much more focused  I don't drift off when I'm speaking to clients and feel more motivated to finish my work on time.  I'm also  not binging as often as I used to  which is extremely helpful since I have gained 10 pounds in the last 6 months.  I don't feel aggressive or angry to the point where its affecting my life and hurting others.  Of course  I still have to make some behavioral changes to improve my organizational skills  but that's not something any medication can fix.  Don't expect it to change everything  as part of the treatment for ADHD is to learn new tools to combat the symptoms.  This medication is not a good idea if you or any family members have a history of substance abuse or dependence  since you are predisposed to those conditions.  If you have any psychiatric issues in addition to the ADHD  you must speak with your doctor about them  since treatment will be counterproductive.  You play the greatest role in your treatment-not the medication.

He has improved his focus at school. Surprisingly even his handwriting improves with the medication. His teachers can tell immediately if I forget a dose. It works well for him in school  but he has gone from being a sweet and gentle kid to an angry person. He acts almost manic- huge mood swings- from happy and confident to overreacting and hypersensitive and angry. I am not sure how to manage his schooling if I take him off of it  but his mood disorder is becoming more pronounced as he is nearing adolescence.

BBB,11/20/2008 0:22,(19-24),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,3,5,16,I was diagnosed with ADD in the third grade and was part of a national study (I Later learned) researching Rittalin<----(Spell Check). This was my second round in the third grade after being held back because of lack of attention and comprehension. Throughout the years I went off and on with various ADD medications trying to find out what works best for me. I am now looking at graduating college in December and was prescribed Adderall at the beginning of this semester. I have been a stellar student this semester and have accomplished more in one semester than I have in my entire collegiate career. I echo some of the previous posts regarding the problem with jitters and increases in tobacco use. I am not a a doctor and in no way am I posing as one on this blog. However   i would recommend if you are seeing an increase in your tobacco habits try using hard candies to suck on when you have the urge to smoke your 4th cigarette in a row  this helped me reduce my urges and aided the hand to mouth habit that is associated with many smokers. Again  this may or may not help you at all and if you are concerned you should inform for doctor immediatly.

I have been very successful in my career  just exhausted with trying to keep all of the thoughts in order.  I am able to get things done and it makes me very calm.  I worry about becoming dependent on it  so I am looking for some natural alternatives so I do not have to stay on for several years.  I have read that ADD and sleep apnea are common.  So I am planning on getting sleep study to see if this may be part of the reason.

fashiongirl,10/31/2008 15:13,(19-24),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,4,5,4,14,I was diagnosed with borderline narcolepsy  CFS  and fibromyalgia as a young teenager.  I have taken many things to keep me awake-uncluding provigil and ritalin.  Provigil helped  but I was still tired all of the time and would still fall asleep at the drop of a hat.  I have been taking adderall 20mg 2x a day for only a short time.  It has made a big difference so far.  I am always very careful with medications  so I am very nervous about the long term effects.  When I take adderall  I do not want to eat for 3-4 hours after  so I have not been eating breakfast or lunch.  My boyfriend and my mom (the closest people to me) have noticed a change in me.  I can make decisions easily (never used to be able to do this) and I am not as emotional.  It has helped me to stay awake  focus  and live like someone without sleep disorders  so for the time being-I am very happy.
schwartzb17@gmail.com,10/30/2008 21:30,(13-18),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,4,23,"I began taking adderall at 15mg when I was in the 4th grade (2001-2002) I lost about 28 pounds almost immediatly which was not a bad thing because I was about 30 pounds over weight. My doctor moved me down to 12 mg to stop the weight lose  which it did. I did however notice that it was not working as well so I was placed back onto 15 mg. The 15 mg dosage no longer worked as well as it originally did so I was bumped up to 20 mg and than once again to 25mg and in the 8th grade I was finally bumped up to 30mg where I remain to this day in the 11th grade.

sigh of the relieved,10/29/2008 1:06,(25-34),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,4,41,I feel like I'm back in control of my thoughts and I'm able to go to sleep at night without my thoughts shifting into high speed. I'm able to look at people now and be able to have a conversation without tripping over my own tongue(saying something that doesn't make any sense). I feel confident about just being me for the first time in my life and I'm 32yrs.old. The medicine doesn't make me feel drugged up like other meds I've taken in the past. Which was due to the fact that some doctors brushed it off as conditions such as depression or just anxiety(due to being depressed). It really has fixed some major problems in my whole overall way of life. I'm very pleased that I have control back over myself again and hope it stays this way.

KrazieDaizie,10/21/2008 11:39,(3-6),Male,Caregiver,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,1,4,17,My six year old step-son is diagnosed with Autism and ADHD. His mother had him put on this medication about two months ago. The first day was great. But since then  we are in a situation that is far worse than before. He is very angry  violent  and destructive. We have three other young children and our six year old hits then  kicks then  and goes out of his way to couse then harm. After reading these reviews  my husband and i are calling his doctor to see if his meds can be switched. There are some pretty scary stories in these reviews. I would seriously reccomend reading the positive and negative comments before putting your child on this medication. In our opinion  our son is getting worse and not at all better. Be aware of all side effects  please.
Nein,10/20/2008 18:10,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,5,10,"I have mild-moderate ADD  but without the hyperactivity. I have been on and off adderall  and usually on very small dosages.  It usually helps  but unfortunately I get side effects pretty bad from stimulant drugs.  The jittery feeling  increased hear rate  and loss of appetite.  The jitters were the worst.  I could focus my mind but I still felt squirmy and totally ""out of it.""  Sometimes  I was TOO focused  and could only concentrate on what was going on in my head  and felt out of touch with the outside world.  As far as concentration for school goes  it was very helpful  but my doctor took me off it because he was worried about my health.  I tried the XR once  but did not like it as much because it took too long to work and was not as strong.  no other drug seems to have been as helpful."

dominoK,10/10/2008 1:21,(45-54),Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,160,"I am a 48 y.o university professor   - after years of frustration and depression because of my procrastination habits and  as I described it  a lack of engagement between my brain and my body. I finally went into therapy just over a year ago at the urging of my wife and was diagnosed with ADHD. I started taking Adderall about 8 months ago. I have found that Adderall is very effective at helping me to focus and listen. It helps me to be more deliberate in my actions  I'm not just drifting through the day. In my classroom I have found that I am able to listen to myself better and not be distracted by those students who give me that 'I'm so bored' look. One of the most interesting effects I've found is that I now actually hear and listen to the lyrics of songs! - never did that before. Looking back at my life  all the way to when I was 6 years old I now recognize the symptoms that had always been there.  I feel that the treatment is working for me  but as my doctor says  the worst part is that I'm 48 and have only now finally taken care of a life-long problem. I take 30 mg. (15 mg standard 2 x a day). I did feel the side effects for about the first two or three days (teeth grinding and dry mouth) but they subsided and I don't have any issues with that now. I've lost a few pounds  but I love to eat and  once I start eating  my appetite is fine. I know that I'll have to continue with this  probably for the rest of my life  but I think of it as a simple compound that my body chemistry is simply missing - so it helps me a lot.
Finally I would say to those of you suffering horrible side effects  stop  and get another opinion! If the side effects are that bad  then you probably have a different problem. Amphetamines are an important drug that can work well for those who need it  but if you don't  you are abusing it. I thought that it would be like the speed we experimented with in high school  but it's not. It is an essential part of my life now  stigma or not -"

I still catch myself not listening while I'm spoken to and I honestly don't know if adderall is worth all the conditions I read about.  I read that there is usually withdrawel when this drug is abused.  I took it for a few weeks  never took more than the prescribed dose and sometimes took half the dose.  I then took nothing for a few days and felt extremely tired.

I switched over from Focalin because that drug did little to improve my ADD; it just made me irritable once it wore off. I'm on 30 mg twice a day now. The drug puts me in a good place but it doesn't seem to accomplish its actual purpose. I know I've become dependent on it even in this short period of time. Other users have noted this drug should be avoided if you have an addictive personality. I agree completely. It never occured to me that I might have ADD I was more concerned about my depression. Anyways  my psych noted that I consume about three caffinated drinks a day along with a pack and a half of cigarettes. Now this drug is just another one of the stimulants I consume throughout the day to feel normal  or at least like what I have come to consider ""normal."" Seriously  I've met herion addicts who expressed concern when I told them I take Adderall. This drug is dangerous. Part of me thinks the companies behind it are guilty of endangering a lot of people  but when I remember how I felt just after a few days of being off it  you won't see me trying to stop them."
DevinT,9/27/2008 17:21,(19-24),,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,4,18,"In high school  my mom kept on me to do my schoolwork  which was good.  However  half way through college  I started failing classes not having support  so I went to the school counselor.

She helped me out a bit with a schedule  but still in crunch time  halfway through a Term (quarter)  I just couldn't focus for homework.  She brought up ADD  so I contacted a Psychiatrist.

My psychiatrist wasn't there  so I had my initial assessment with a stand in.  She said I probably have Bipolar II (hypomanic-depressive).  Shocked  I still geared up and looked up symptoms and this and that.  Sure  so I have mild/moderate Bipolar...I thought everyone did.

I had an appointment with my real psychiatrist  and he was on the edge on if I was Bipolar or ADD.  Apparently  a lot of the symptoms overlap.  It was possible I have both  though  so I scheduled another appointment and took Lamictal for BP2.

The appointment after that was halfway through the term.  The mood swings were better  but I still couldn't focus.  I was ""driven to distraction"" as he put it.  I would procrastinate to the point where I was not confident I could get the work done  and then to cheer myself up  I would do the very thing that I used to procrastinate (like a video game).

He prescribed me this stuff  Amphetamine Salts.  I took it the day after he prescribed it...and for good reason.  I had an assignment due the next morning.  I had a meeting to prepare for and run.  I had important people to email.

It felt like I was sipping on a heavily caffeinated beverage all day.  That's when I'm most motivated.  I got all the emails sent out  I ran the meeting just fine  and I edited 8 pages of a document that I have been sitting on for over a year.

The side effects I experienced were dry mouth  muscle tension  strange busts of tiredness that go away in 10 minutes  high blood pressure (expected)  feeling a little cold  easy smiling  and restlessness.

It's been 3 days.  I actually WANT to do work now.  So weird..."
Success from St. Louis,9/25/2008 19:13,(25-34),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Other,5,5,4,30,"I have been taking Adderall for six years now and what a difference it has made in my life.  I was finally diagnosed w/ADD when I was 20.  All my life I STRUGGLED through school (constantly daydreaming  forgetting assignments  awful  comprehension). I studied so hard and still earned mostly Cs. Teachers suggested to my parents that I be tested for ADD but I refused because I thought it meant I was dumb.  When I went away to college I did not have my parents reminding me to study or do homework.  The work load and subject matter was increasingly more difficult until one semester I ended up with a 1.5 GPA.  At that point I had enough of the struggle and I made an appointment with my Doctor.  After going through testing I was diagnosed with ADD and was put on Adderall.  I suddenly started to really enjoy school and on top of it all  I really wasn't dumb.  I ended that semester with a 3.85 GPA.  I got an A in Quantitative Business Statistics and loved the class. I continued on with excellent grades and enjoying school and graduated from a State University with a Bachelor of Science.  My only regret is not starting this treatment sooner.  I think that years of struggling through school  feeling left behind  and feeling ""stupid"" has a negative impact on a child's development of self confidence  self esteem  and perseverance in life. For people that are ""on the fence"" about taking medication or allowing their child to take meds to treat truly DIAGNOSED ADD/ADHD  ask yourself this..... If(you/your child) had diabetes would you not give your(self/child) insulin?  Everyone should have all the tools they need to succeed.  I am thrilled to be succeeding in life!!"

I stopped taking it for one year and returned to my problem of not being able to focus and complete a task.  I asked for a low dose 5mg. (not XR) that I could take once or twice a day as needed.  This has worked well for me  keeping my focus  completing tasks and no side effects.  On days when I don't take it at all  it doesn't seem to bother me.

For those who complain that they are ""addicted"" and this is a ""bad"" medicine.

dd,8/5/2008 17:41,(25-34),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,5,135,I am a mental health therapist  and reading these reviews of Adderall makes me want to laugh and cry at the same time.  I am also taking adderall  and know in my heart that I am addicted  and struggle with knowing this everyday.  With not wanting to refill my script  but knowing that the addict in me will call my doctor and get a refill.  Knowing that I will become emotionless and cold  sleepless and edgy  but with a clean house and unhappy children who don't understand why their mom is so tense and angry.  I know that I will start having to take Zanax and Ambien to calm down at night  and that the divide between my husband and I will grow bigger.  This medication helped me at first  it felt like legal meth.  Because that is what it is.  The sad thing is  I was working in the substance abuse field when I began by adderall journey.  I am not saying that everyone will experience what I am going through  but my sister also has the exact same problems.  While I thought we would be having cookouts and taking our kids to the park  instead we are swapping scripts and pills and cleaning tips.  I caution everyone who is thinking about taking this drug to consider whether they can do it responsibly  and their family history of addiction.  Reading these other reviews makes me feel much less alone  but also very sad that so many people are having these problems.  I realize that I may need help to get off of it  but that is very hard when you work in the field that I do and your professional reputation is on the line.  I use up my script in less than two weeks  and then have two weeks without it.  The two weeks w/out it are so much better  but the addict in me never listens.  Every month I think I can do it responsibly.  I just wonder  when is it gonna be to much?  I know the saying one is to many and a thousand is never enough.  In my case  that is so true.  Please be careful.

    I have a ""Mentally challenged"" friend who has adhd or a.d.d and he had a prescription of Adderall.Since I was a stupid young teen I loved experimenting with pills I had no prescription to.
After the first pill I felt on top of the world.I could speak better/faster/more intelligent.I could focuse better I had NO ANXIETY what so ever of any sort.I had REALLY bad social anxiety and fears of situations before they even happend.But with Adderal it disapeared 110%.In fact with Adderall I WANTED! to go out and socialize when usually I would just hide in my room for days/weeks/months((no joke))
so finally I got my own perscription.The doctor wasnt sure about it but I told him about all the countless benifits I was having and he finally let me have it.
    Of course there was a downside to this to though =(  Eventually I started to abuse it.Taking it more often than I should have.I would even chop it up and let it dissolve in water.Stay up all night & pull all nighters (which was still kinda fun  I got to wright some of my best guitar riffs back then and clean my room spic and span)) but I got real irritable when taking tooo much.OMG and the TEETH GRINDING LOL!!!!Another thing I disliked about being on close to slightly over amount is my penis would shrink greatly lol.Though I could still ""get it up"" when needed.It looks like I came out of cold pool.
    Anyway    I really miss this pill almost 10 years have past I'd like to give it another try but be a little more responsible this time."

I started Adderall about 10 months ago.  I am currently on a 60mg dosage  yes a lot  but I am also bi-polar.  It has been fantastic for me.  I have been much more productive at work  and have felt more stable with my mood.  I have lost weight  no tears over that  but I haven't changed my eating habits.  No other side effects really!

I didn't even want to get out of bed in the morning. I couldn't function and my thoughts and actions were scrambled. Adderall has really helped my overall condition  although i dont like the 'speed-like' feeling i get from it sometimes. My Dr. prescribed me on 15 mg then to 20mg. The 20mg is usually too much so i take 10mg in the am and 10mg later on. It has been a life-saver. I am aware of the abuse of this medication  also  and I was worried at first about taking it  but hopefully i wont have problem coming off of it in the future.

mylifearemyboys4,7/18/2008 20:07,(25-34),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,1,19,"I have been switching between Adderall XR and Adderall non-time released for about 3 years. Right now I take 90 milligrams a day of Adderall non-time released. I have days where I am tired  on these days I take more than perscribed. In my opinion Adderall is highly ""abusive"". When you take a medication long enough your body becomes immune and the medication isnt as effective as it was when you first started taking it.

I dont think Adderall should be prescribed to children under the age of 18. All it takes is a simple 20 question evaluation and you are prescribed a drug that may forever change your life. 

I have tried to stop taking Adderall and I have not been successful yet. I get so mad at myself when I sleep for 5 days straight (when im finally back to normal) and then go back to the Adderall.

My advice to anyone condsidering this medication is to get a second opinion. Honestly  I know I dont have ADHD or ADD  the Adderall makes me have ADHD. I didnt need this medication when I was prescribed it 3 years ago and now I cant get away from it. I have faith in God that He will get me through this and allow me to feel again. The Will of God will never take you where the grace of God cannot protect you. God bless you all!!"
Truth,7/14/2008 1:47,,,None,None,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,2,25,I believe I have a mix of hyperactivity and inattentivness.. I'm easily distracted  like to be on the move (as if driven by a motor)  its hard to stay on task  I zone-out/daydream here & there  I find it hard to be motivated  especially in school (unless I am genuinely interested in the material & feel it really applies to my life). I procrastinate  can be quite disorganized  and stress out because of this all! Thats when I dont take Adderall.  Only somewhat effective because the tablets tend to wear off as the day progresses which results in irritability  they initially get me down to business. I'd hoped that side-effecrs wouldnt apply to be but well in reality they do. this drug really is no joke and should be taken seriously because of its habit-forming tendency. i dont like the idea of depending on a substance to do things i used to be able to do without it. true  those things were harder to do before Adderall  but
wetwonderland,7/11/2008 2:59,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,4,5,5,27,I suffer from chronic fatigue.  After trying several different meds  this one is the only one that has made a difference in my ability to wake up and get going.  A big difference.  I take 40 mgs when I get up and sometimes another 20 in the afternoon.  It has made my life so much better.  It is not perfect  but I'd rather take it than feel like I did before.  When my new Dr. said she wouldn't be able to prescribe it  I cried.  My quality of life was at stake.  I changed doctors.

CollegeStudent,6/26/2008 18:00,(19-24),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,4,36,"I am a 23 year old college student.  I started taking adderall to help me with my school work about 7 months ago.  Before the medicine I procrastinated  could not finish a projects  was disinterested  and unmotivated.  When I take this medication I shed all of those characteristics. I am able to study for about 5-8 hours straight and obtain all the information. I am in my senior year of college and thought I could use a push to finish the hard classes. I became interested in learning; I grasped concepts easily  and became level headed and rational.  I will say though  there is a huge downside.  I got bad headaches  lost ten pounds  blacked out frequently for a second when I stood up  chest pains  and numbness in my hands. When on the medication  I lost my connection to emotion and was very irritable.  I tended to be cold and distant.  I know this medicine works but I did not want to put my body through the side effects any longer.

I have stopped taking this due to the person I was becoming.  It takes more discipline for me to study and stay focused but at least I feel like my true self. 
This drug is habit forming. I thought I could not get an A on a test without it  but I did and I can.  Plus now when I get an A it is more rewarding knowing it was all me who earned  not the adderall."
,6/26/2008 0:54,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,2,48,Freshman yr of college i was diagnosed with ADD  the Inattentive kind. My experience with Adderall has been a love/hate relationship. I started on 20mg in a.m. & 10mg in p.m. It gave me more energy  made me mentally sharper & I felt normal & happier since I was more able to communicate & think clearly. I was happy.. at first. Then I noticed I could stay up WAY late. Then I'd sleep in & miss the classes I'd finally begun thoroughly doing the work for. Also  friends pointed out Id become irritable & mean at times. I agreed but was upset because of all the good adderall was doing for me otherwise. The tablets wore off later in the day  causing my moods. My prescriber recommended a higher dose  I agreed & I liked it  I was focused on getting my stuff done. STILL  I was.. cold  emotions were distant. IMPORTANT
Spinnin,6/23/2008 11:10,(25-34),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,3,2,12,I have been on adderall (20mg) for about 5 years. It is a hardcore stimulant that is similar to an illegal group of drugs if you catch my drift. Has helped me but I'm not sure if the benefit has exceeded the cost. I can't imagine children taking it so do your research first. Causes anxiety  mood swings  and an overall feeling that can only be described as BLAH.
RoseJPark,6/13/2008 16:47,(45-54),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,4,4,5,9,I have been 20 mgs of Adderall per day for around a month's time.  I notice I am able to concentrate and focus better. My boss says I look less tense.  I don't take things so personally and my self esteem is increasing.  I have difficulty with math and understanding what I read  but I am hopeful I will improve in that area.  This medication has given me hope.  I also have depression and take zoloft.  One thing I've noticed is sometimes I get extremely sleepy in the afternoon.

lp2u2,6/12/2008 0:23,(55-64),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,3,4,16,"I have been on Adderall now for 2.5 years. I am also on Zoloft & Lamictal. I have noticed an increase in anger and rage over the last 2 years or so  and I have been researching ALL of these drugs in order to find out if all 3 are causing these highly charged emotions  or just one or two. The smallest incident can absolutely en-rage me to the point of screaming and then crying out of frustration or just plain anger. I'm wondering if anyone else has these issues with adderall  in particular. I am not even sure I could function without this drug  but I want off ALL of them and I need to taper myself off them. I know my liver is damaged from them  and I fear with the anger I have inside me  someone will get hurt or someone will hurt me. Another issue for me is that these drugs aren't manufactured in the United States  and the big Pharmaceuticals contract with China & India which aren't quality controlled. This actually makes me VERY angry  so I am going to get off these and try to be normal  and IF I still have these destructive emotions when I'm off them  then I must seek help elsewhere. Adderall in my opinion is a very dangerous drug and giving any ADD drug to a child  adolescent or adult is irresponsible and the drug companies do NOT give a hoot about people  as it is ALL about PROFIT. The FDA is just as corrupt as the big Pharma  and together they are in collusion and both have made billions on people's lives and deaths.
Research it yourself and open your eyes to the corruption in our country  including our own government in regard to the big Pharma's and the FDA. It will scare the HELL out of you!!!"
grj1983,6/10/2008 4:07,(25-34),Female,Patient,10 years or more,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,2,1,26,It's a restricted prescription  just like narcotics. It's hard for me to obtain but if I don't I do bad things. I hit someone head on in my car  for ex. I think taking this drug for 10 years (since age 15 or 16 or so)  has also had me turn into a raging psychopath when I'm coming off it. It only gets worse. I don't know I am acting badly  other people who know me complain. I think it's impossible to fix ADD or ADHD  because... why is it such a problem to not be able to sit still? Isn't everyone fat these days because they are far too lazy? Seems dumb to try to fix people who are hyper or not attentive. The world is a boring place. School is boring too. While this substance improved my grades during school  I found no satisfaction in my life. It numbs my feelings. It makes me more agressive and mean. But as far as helping ADD or ADHD  I don't think it does that at all anymore. My thoughts still race  I still get distracted  I am still bouncing with energy. I am on 90mg a day. Thats as high as it gets. Even though it doesn't help  I take it because I am afraid I will hurt someone else if I stop. I do not know who I am without this medication. People who take it to feel less tired are abusing it. People who give it to kids SHOULD NOT. People who take it to be less depressed are abusing it. It's not for depression. I'd reccomend exersize for that (not a doc). Besides all that  I'm tired of having to spend my time chasing after this drug every month to fill up on my prescription  because some people think it's cool to take it recreationally. THAT is the dumbest thing of all. This is the least fun drug  ever. They should adjust it so there is no more false euphoria from this drug in anyone. I never felt euphoria of any kind from it. But to give it to a kid that DOES (even legally)  I could see it as being addictive. I've been medicated since I was 5  Ritilan  countless anti-depressants and then back to the desoxyn and Adderall.Yeah-I don't even talk to my parents anymore.

jdanny02@comcast.net,6/3/2008 0:27,(55-64),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,3,3,4,8,Had been taking ritalin before.  Feel this med must be a little stronger!  Would be very cautious about giving to children especially younger ones. Seems I've had more severe mood swings with this med.  Believe the ritalin worked a little better & probably would be better off w/o it too. Started these type meds during period of extreme stress mainly for depression.  Now that stress is less believe I've become a little too dependant on it. I would suggest trying all other measures first & especially with children who are dependant on the parents judgment. My Doctor said he would be curious as to how much physical activity a child is getting before trying these type meds. Maybe try increasing that first. Basically proceed with caution & honesty.

,5/9/2008 16:12,(25-34),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,3,9,For Adult ADD - I've just had issues with getting the ideal dosing schedule with this. Has made me stop taking my SSRI  and feel like I accomplish things. Was taking 20mg XR once daily  then twice daily  but due to price  went to plain. Seems to work longer than XR. But through discussions with my dr  we've decided to do the 20mg plain  and depending on how I feel  can take a 1/4  1/2  3/4 or whole pill. Prescribed at 1 pill b.i.d. but may drop to 1/2 pill b.i.d. with 1/2 pill p.r.n. ... This med has worked wonders in me. Won't recommend it to anyone  though  because it is a Class II controlled substance and they may sound like an addict going to their Dr.
Taximan,5/9/2008 9:32,(55-64),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,5,5,5,11,I was given 15 mg a day of this for my chronic exhaustion. However  I quickly realized that it has made my depression go away. The problem is I need about 40 - 60 mg to get rid of the depression. My pdoc won't give me that much  and so I remain depressed. I don't know what to do because nothing makes my depression go away like Adderall does. I also find it's not necessary to take it everyday. I find it best to skip every 3rd day so I can sleep. It does cause insomnia  but I had that before I ever took Adderall. This is like a miracle drug for me. Now if only I knew a doc who would give me enough to last all month.

brett,5/6/2008 18:26,(19-24),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,4,5,25,I'm 20 and in my first year of college. I was diagnosed with ADD in 6th Grade for my lack of ability to concentrate  I was/am quite the day dreamer. The Doc put me on 5mg Adderall XR I believe. My freshman year the dose was increased to 10mg. At the time I didn't know fully how it effected me  all I knew is that it made me want to throw desks at the teachers that irritated me  and that I was unhappy and pissed of for no reason. I switched from adderall to stratera  then to ritali LA  but I prefered not taking anything because of how they effected me. In January I started back on Adderal XR @ 15mg and I told myself that it's worth the sacrifice to have good grades and be able to focus  but I  now that I am older I am more aware of how it effects me. My grades immediately went from C's to high B's and the Highest gpa I've had in years. I quit taking it when I realized that it was destroying my life in the following ways
brightdreamer,5/3/2008 18:16,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,4,3,12,I was taking this for ADD without hyperactivity. It seemed to help at first  I was concentrating better  keeping up with tasks  and getting more things done. However  I'm also being treated for depression  and after only a few weeks I started noticing the symptoms of my depression coming back. After a full month on the drug  I was extremely irritable  overreacting to stress  crying at every little thing  snapping at friends and family... I really damaged a relationship with one friend  sadly. Upon talking to my doctor  I found out that Adderall can cause heightened emotions  which is exactly what I was trying to treat with the depression medication! She offered to put me on a mood stabilizer drug as well  but I said just take me off the Adderall and try something else for the ADD rather than adding another drug to fix its side effects. I'm trying Strattera now  we'll see how it works. The drug did what it was supposed to do  but honestly  my ADD isn't bad enough to warrant taking a drug with this kind of side effect.

,4/28/2008 13:39,(25-34),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Other,1,3,5,13,I first saw a doctor when I was 17 yrs. old seeking treatment for depression and constant lethargy. However  after answering a short questionnaire  I was diagnosed with ADD  and have been on Adderall (which was helpful at first) ever since. Now  I've been on the medication so long that I can't remember who  or how I was before I started taking it. In addition to causing my mild OCD to become full blown routine-altering OCD  I find that the medication increases my irritability 10 fold (especially when it's wearing off  and especially within the last year). I'm not sure if it is the medication or simply life circumstances that is now causing me severe depression  extreme lack of motivation  and weird and very sudden mood swings. I have also experienced more common side effects  like jaw clenching  tension  dizziness  and increased heart rate. I would like to try to stop taking the medication now  but feel I am dependent on it and am afraid of the withdrawal effects. I worry about the long term side effects that I may experience from taking this drug for so long  and the misery that it may/may not be causing me presently. I would NEVER consider putting a child on this medication.
Cat-mom,4/27/2008 15:04,(35-44),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,4,101,"I have taken a low dose of adderall for about five years  and it has changed my life. 

My ability to think ahead  anticipate and avoid problems has dramatically improved. My abilty to articulate myself improves dramatically on adderal  especially with a low dose.  I can understand the consequences of my actions with a clarity that I wish I had earlier in life J My over-all attention span has dramatically improved in the last five years  and it remains significantly higher even on days when I choose not to take adderall. To me  that is amazing. Tasks I once found painful  I can now do quickly an efficiently with patience and perfect detail  even off adderall. A large part of why I think I see a lot of improvement is not just the medication  but also all the other things I do to combat ADHD.

When I need to learn something new (e.g. a software program at work) adderal helps me quickly learn and absorb the new information  and remember facts. It is a dramatic change from my past abilities.

When I first started taking the drug  I had heart palpitations. It is definitely hard on the heart. BUT then I started to add regular  gentle but rigorous aerobic exercise to my routine (which  btw  is a non-prescription treatment for ADHD)  my heart became stronger  more conditioned than before and the palpitations stopped. My resting hr is 45 bpm  and my blood pressure is ideal  or close to it. This also will solve any insomnia problems.

I recommend this drug  FOR THE RIGHT PERSON. Fact is we are all built differently. Which is the whole reason why drugs like this are made in the first place. Depending on your peculiarities  it may not give you exactly what you need.  That doesnt mean this drug wont be very helpful to someone else. I look forward to the day when these types of drugs can be prescribed and monitored more accurately."

c_jernigan,4/21/2008 11:26,(35-44),Male,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,5,18,"My initial response to Adderall XR was great - it changed my life  but then ... and there is always a ""but"" in life - the effects began to wear off and then I think that Adderall began muting my endocrine system.  In a nutshell - it significantly reduced my level of perceived anxiety. I didn't realize it  but I was probably living with a ""4"" on a 1 - 10 scale for general anxiety.  Adderall brought me down to a 1 or 2.  I think that basically after a month or two my adrenaline and other things were basically either all used up  or the receptor sites were burned out.  Basically there was no ""fire"" because all of the fuel had been burned up.  Also  I think that I had some mild depression creeping in - I became somewhat unmotivated  and really didn't want to do much physically.

After about 1 year my libido dropped like a rock  my testicles felt as if they had shrunken to 1/2 their normal size.  My body temperature was always low - it was routinely in the mid 96 to low 97 range.  I had no physical strength nor endurance - where I had been previously in good shape and could crank out 25 pushups at any given time  I could only manage 20 or so ""girl"" pushups (supported by knees) after which time I was exhausted.  After working out  I didn't feel as if I was gaining any benefit or very minor benefit  almost as if I was having a muted recovery.  

After initially becoming more organized I began slipping back  then I was maybe only 25% of my initial organization. 

I have stopped taking XR on a daily basis and have begun taking it only ""as needed"" - what my doctor doesn't know will not hurt him.  I think that something needs to be recharged - I am now an advocate of ""drug holidays""  every other day usage  or simply ""as needed"" be that at work  or home. 

I never found myself feeling mentally addicted - but I did have brain fog for a couple of days when stepping down.

,4/16/2008 19:26,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,32,I have been taking the XR 20mg a day for about 6 months now and it has completely changed my life. You would have never known I had an attention problem because I was a very active teenager.  I was involved in sports  many extracuricular activities and worked since I was 16 so my mind was constantly focused on something different.  It became a problem after becoming a single mom.  I couldn't organize any thought.  If there was too much going on I couldn't focus to organize it.  I didn't pay bills  I took extreme chances  and even forgot I was a mom sometimes.  After finally confessing to my mother how i felt she suggested talking to my PCP.  He gave me the 20mg XR 6 months ago and now I feel as though I am actually living my life.  I have since fixed my finances  gotten promoted at work  and enjoy my time with my daughter so much more.  I would suggest this treament to anyone as long as their Dr. agrees.  Use caution when taking this it can be very addicting  and should not for children that have no gone through puberty.  i have lost 30 pounds since start because of the lack of appetite and amount of exercise i do.  I also have about two nights a week that i have trouble falling asleep.  over all I thank myself every day for being able to communicate how I felt.  I am finally the person I always wanted to be and never thought could be.
,4/16/2008 15:37,(45-54),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,1,2,11,this drug causes extreme depression after extended use. i believe this drug should be taken OFF the market and reevaluated. this drug can cause thoughts of suicide  eratic behavior  mood swings  bouts of hysteria and overall should be in a class of its own for ONLY the severely mentally ill that need institutionalizing! the fact that CHILDREN are taking this drug is HORRIFIC and is going to end up doing more damage then good in the longrun. i truly believe that this is one of our biggest problems in America today....adults and worse yet CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS running around 0n legal meth!!!! get rid of this drug  and more importantly the thought process that people need this to pay attention.
calcal,4/16/2008 15:33,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,3,16,I loved being on adderall. But after heart palipitations I decided to stop - feeling additionally like I was becoming addicted. I suffered from complete drug induced psychosis that was misdiagnosed as bi-polar and caused me to have a total break down. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG it is dangerous! Do not stop taking adderal cold turkey either it also causes bad things to happen!
JennF,4/13/2008 21:43,(25-34),Female,None,None,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,4,4,5,11,I have narcolepsy cataplexy and sev. day time sleep disorder and I have done the 200mg Provigil and was up to 50mg 2/day of rittalin and nothing has helped. Now im on 30 mg of addarall 2/day and for now it seems to be helping. Although I have not experienced any of the good side effects.
,4/8/2008 23:33,(7-12),,Caregiver,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,2,2,3,my daughter been on this med for 3months and she still having  a very hard time in school also at th e beginning it hurt her belly...
,4/2/2008 20:59,(25-34),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,5,5,31,I have been on Adderall for 3 years now.  Its been a miracle for my school and work life.  However  this drug is addicting and can easily be abused.  It has really helped me but I worry about my dependence on it and the effects it may be having on my heart in the long run.  Using this drug takes a lot of self discipline but if you can be responsible with it it can truly help the quality of your life.  I have suffered with Attention Deficit problems my entire life and once I was diagnosed as an adult and I started taking this drug I finally felt like I was a normal functioning human being.  I am not a space cadet anymore  I can finish tasks  ext...  I recommend this drug but with caution.
Jonathan,4/2/2008 20:02,(35-44),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,4,4,10,"I recently learned that I have ADD at age 36 and my doctor put me on 20mg of Adderall XR and I noticed that I get tired around 3pm.  It's difficult for me to sleep sound (taking 1 mg of Ativan at bedtime)  so I'm not sure about taking another dose.  I'll be increasing to 30mg in 1 week  but will that help my afternoon crash?  Also  is there anything out there that can help me sleep better?
Overall  I'm super stoked on Adderall...It's been the only thing that has helped me concentrate (I'm reading books like I just discovered how to read)..."
Ben,4/1/2008 21:31,(19-24),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,25,Started taking Adderall 5 years ago and it has worked incredibly well. I set the alarm for an hour before I need to be up and when the alarm goes off  I wake up just long enough to swallow the pill with a bunch of water then I go back to sleep. Without fail  I wake up almost exactly an hour later feeling awake and energetic. The energy continues throughout the day and wears off in time for me to fall asleep easily. Until the early evening I have very little appetite but if I decide I have to eat  it's not difficult and generally my appetite returns a bit once i start eating. I feel totally able to pay attention to my work  writing papers  reading textbooks  focusing in lectures which was impossible before Adderall or when I miss a dose. I took Ritalin for several months before switching to Adderall with no effect at all.
,3/29/2008 13:28,(13-18),Male,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,3,3,7,The side effects have been fairly harsh for me. My mouth is incredibly dry  my appetite is nearly non-existent  I am not as interested in things as I usually am (depression)  I don't feel like being very social and talking to people  and it takes around 2 hours for me to fall asleep if conditions are not entirely favorable.
Jason,3/21/2008 19:02,(19-24),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,4,5,5,I needed this to help get me through exams. It helped alright. It helped me pull al-nights without feeling tired the next morning. I could work through the whole night in fact. However  it took a full 24 hours to get out of my system. Until then. no matter how badly my system craved sleep  I didn't feel tired and could not fall asleep. I felt really miserable. Without it  I wouldnt have dont well on my exams. But I would never take this unless I had to. It makes you feel funny. puts pressure on your head  and makes you stay awake. Overall  not fun to be on. A better schedule works much better. (I was on 20mg non xr).
,3/16/2008 12:41,(25-34),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,5,8,I am 26 yeras old and have been on stimulant medication since the age of 4 for ADHD. I switched to the oral 20mg tablet Adderall when I was 18. Overall  it has been very effective. However  the side effects as of late have been interfering with my job. 2 hours after taking the medication with food  I begin to hot flash and sweat a lot. I drink massive amounts of water to counter this  but then am left with having to urinate constantly. I also experience bad cotton mouth.

msteg,3/15/2008 19:07,(35-44),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,4,5,12,After taking Adderall for a couple of years I began having a high heart rate (105 at rest).  I also have heart palpitations.  I've been off this drug for 3 months and my heart rate is still irregular.  I consider this a dangerous drug.
lordylordy40,3/13/2008 8:35,(45-54),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Other,2,2,5,5,i have been taking adderall for around 7 yrs. and i think that my body is not responding to it anymore.
Cheezdanish,3/9/2008 3:19,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Other,4,5,4,18,I wasn't diagnosed with ADD until my sophmore year of college. I was finally able to concentrate  organize  and FINISH tasks. I could read w/o back tracking  and actually remember what I had read. I did notice that I would become easily aggravated (mostly in the afternoon) and somewhat OCD at times...However  I found that keeping an established routine of eating breakfast + snacks and getting a full 8 hours of sleep a night greatly diminished those side effects.
,3/7/2008 16:13,(13-18),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,1,3,3,11,My son has been taking Lexapro for 2 months now and it did wonders for his anxiety.  Before taking Lexapro  he was nausus & sick to his stomach at school.  The doctor added adderall to the mix yesterday and wow  explosive - my son had a huge anger episode at school (very unlike him) and just got totally out of control - his heart rate was up dramatically as well as his blood pressure.  Be careful of mixing drugs.
savanna0599,3/3/2008 6:59,(25-34),Female,Caregiver,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,16,I was told my daughter was adhd when she was 5 and now she is 9  at first she took ritalin no luck then we tried adderall XR and had nothing but great luck with this drug. just remember some drugs dont work for some people- so you might have a to try a few to get one that works for you.this drug has changed my daughters life and continues to exxcell in school
,3/1/2008 0:21,(25-34),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,103,I have always struggled in school and my parents did not believe in ADD or ADHD.  I would listen to someone talk to me for 10 minutes and not be able to tell you one word that they said.  I went from a D student at a very good university to making the Dean's list.  I have read a few negative reviews of this drug  and I must say that I believe those who had negative opinions about the drug were either on the wrong dosage  or did not need the medication in the first place.  This medecation has changed my life. After 5 years of struggling in college I finally graduated  1 year after starting adderall.  I am proud of myself and proud of my work.  Also   I no longer experience the anxiety that I always had before I started the medication.  I would use caution while taking this medicine  because it can be easily abused.  If you abuse it  you will not get the results that the medication is prescribed for.  If you start taking it for the purpose that it is intended for  it can and will change your life.
Miss Bonner,2/29/2008 1:42,(25-34),Female,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,1,1,1,18,"I have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder along with PTSD since I was thirteen. I am now 25  and I decided to try this medication perscribed by my new psychiatrist; who has rediagnosed me with ADHD.  
During the first day of two 30mg. tablets I did fine  with the exception of a few jitters.  I wasn't sleepy or depressed as usual.  After consulting my doctor  he said it was a sign that I should double my dosage.  Then came the second and third days.  I was a maniac!  I would sit for hours preforming illogical tasks that I couldn't stop; like combing my hair for 6 hours.  My eyes were dialated  I ached from being tense  and I also felt disconnected from the world.  I was very irritable  paranoid  dizzy  sweating  short of breath  and OCD.  I couldn't fall asleep without prescription medications.  I was too anxious to even take the trash out.  I will never take stimulants of this kind again.  Afterall  I know I am bipolor  but the thought of removing that diagnosis gained enough of my trust to try stimulants.  I've never felt more crazy!  The days just flew by and I have no idea what I did.  Needless to say  I'm looking for a new doctor."
,2/27/2008 1:16,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Other,2,2,1,13,"I was prescribed adderall for ADD without hyperactivity 15mg 2x a day. It is very difficult to take this medicine as prescribed because it keeps me up all night and has terrible side effects. I've experienced extreme anxiety that did not exist before I started along with chest pain  tightness in my chest  labored breathing  jaw pain/teeth clenching  headaches  dizziness  loss of coordination etc... I've tried lowering the dose as well as raising it but still experience the same sypmtoms. I will be fine taking it if I havent had it in a few days but the come down is so terrible that I am unable to sleep properly for the next 2 days and experience a hangover so terrible that I am unable to take it again for at least 3 days. It did help me concentrate but makes me extremely antisocial and fearful of speaking in a classroom or out in public. I was not like this before I started taking it. I also have been getting terrible panic attacks so bad that I need to lay down and force myself to sleep until it passes. After I did more research on Adderall and realized it was just SYNTHETIC CRYSTAL METH in a pill form I am no longer suprised at the hell I went through. I think it's terrible that the FDA is allowing so many citizen's to become pharmaceutical speed addicts...especially when it is precribed to a child.

J,2/24/2008 16:48,(19-24),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Other,1,1,5,6,"Take 15mg/day for 1 week now. For years I have had a hard time sleeping at night without taking melatonin or simply sleep every night. Also have always had a hard time concentrating and focusing on reading/work. Finally decided to go to a doctor to see what was up. I decided to stop taking all sleeping pills beforehand. Doctor prescribes 15mg/ 2x a day (non-xr  I did not want the XR as I already have a hard enough time falling asleep). After taking adderall for a few days  I has undoubtedly made me MUCH more tired - within an hour or two of taking my pill I could easily fall asleep. In fact  I would prob use these to help me fall asleep as they make me more tired than a full dose of simply sleep. Have not helped at all for concentration or focusing. I feel like I'm more in ""my own little world"" and less hungry. I would find it hard to imagine that taking more would do anything but intensify the effects it has already had."
,2/21/2008 13:27,(55-64),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,2,2,5,6,I was diagnosed in my late 40's and started out on 2 pills  lost 20 lbs (for awhile) but not much in the way of progress.  I still have over a 100 books I've started and not finished.  After about a year on this with my heart rate really starting to scare me I went down to 1 pill a day and my heart doesn't race but I'm not really accomplishing much.  I do stay focused at work which could just be a lifetime of trying to focus.  I still do 20 things at once.

,2/14/2008 20:07,(19-24),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Other,5,5,5,34,I was diagnosed with ADD about 8 mnonths ago and am prescribed to Adderall 20mg 2x a day. I talked to my doctor about it after I got an office job. I too am one of those people that can read every word in a paragraph and have no idea what it said because my mind was elsewhere. I couldn't listen to a solid sentence someone was saying to me for the same reason. After taking adderall I worked so much more efficiently and understood a lot more. It was as if my head was pulled out of a cloud or something. I really wish I had been more aware of this condition in high school. I was always a decent student making average grades but it was very difficult for me to really understand and grasp things  especially in math. I had a very appathetic attitude towards high school and my efforts to go to college were lacking...and as a result of that I still haven't gone back to school. Knowing how much better I could have done in high school if I had been prescribed to it then really makes me wonder how much more I could have accomplished as far as scholarships and things of that nature. Overall  taken responsibly adderall has been 100% effective. The biggest side effect I'v experienced has been a lack of hunger. I've lost probably 20 pounds in the last 8 months. I just make sure I eat before I take it and drink nutritional shakes throughout the day.

Before Adderall I would begin reading the first few pages and not remember or understand what I have just read. And then have to go back again and read it over. Now reading has become a joy. I can for the first time memorize Bible Scripture. I'm focused.
Also finishing projects around my home are completed. Befor I would have 5-6 little fix it jobs all going on and not completed. 
The same at work running around working my butt off and at the end of day  I'll remember invoices not made out that should of been done in the morning. This is all differant now. I do First things First and finish them to the end.

Not diagnosed until my early 40's  I struggled to complete tasks at hand. Now  not only do I complete them  I'm able to go above and beyond the tasks at hand. As well  I'm able to keep my weight at managable levels. Also  my energy levels are up and my depression is all but ameliarated. I just wish the Dr would have found the Dx sooner.

Im very impressed  i have taken ritalin  conserta  and sitera. By far the adderall is the best. Even though everyonce in a while my body builds a tolerence and i have to up the dosage. Mild side affects  loss of appitite  and insomina. But that is only if i take it later then 4pm."
Meka from Texas,2/5/2008 15:54,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,13,doctor put me on Concerta medicine sucks So for the first time I was working on behavioral therapy and counseling for the treatment of adhd and i'll tell you what before concerta I was taking adderral 30MG and never felt this way I feel nervous aggitaded unable to handle any stress. For the first time i see why adderral is such a miracle.  You can still be your self you know chit chat whatever I believe that should never be controlled- and no brain chatter either. I highly reccomend adderall.
,2/1/2008 19:34,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to less than 2 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,5,5,26,This medication is very effective. However this dug is very habit forming and I do not recomend children taking this medication at all. If you have to use this medication use as directed and have someone monitor you while taking  very easy to abuse. I took myself of the medication cause I noticed I was abusing it. The withdrawls off this medication are horrible and I don't recommend stoping this medication suddenly  it hurts. I felt like those people you see on T.V. coming off heroin.

There are times when I still feel sleepy  but overall it has been working well. I haven't fallen asleep at work  as I had been before at least 2 to 3x's a day. I have also been able to feel comfortable driving myself and my son. Before I would have someone drive and there had been incident where I had fallen asleep at the wheel which was very scary.

It has affected my job performance  school and home life. Recently My doctor prescribed me to adderall XR 20mg capsules after i addressed this problem with him. Since taking the medication i have been able to complete tasks without being distracted and my concentration is superb. Places i have felt ""lost"" in thought or daydreaming no longer affect me. Would reccomend for people with this condition but be sure to read all of the literature that comes with the drug."

Hopeful Engineering,1/26/2008 4:41,(19-24),Male,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,4,4,42,I am a 23 year old recent college graduate that has been taking Adderall Oral for the past 6 to 7 months.  I was not diagnosed with ADD/ADHD until the start of my treatment.  With this treatment I have noted some very distinct changes in my performance in college and now in my career.  I am a Mechanical Engineer in NC.  My focus at work seems to be increased but not over the top.  I finally feel that I can start a project and follow it through to the end.  Finishing the minute details that have plagued me in the past and that I have procrastinated with in the past.  I feel that Adderall oral is an effective treatment for my condition.  Although I strongly urge parents and students to take caution with using this treatment option.  I have noticed a weekly to bi-weekly occurrence of limited sleep for one to two nights.  This seems to typically happen on a Friday night and Sunday nights.  As this has continued I feel that there are some other treatments that I should attempt before settling on this one.  Also as I was diagnosed during my final semester of college with ADD/ADHD I noticed that I suddenly had more friends then the prior 5 years of college.  So parents  students in college with go to extreme measures to acquire Adderall from your child. This is also becoming an increasing concern for college campuses across the nation.  Like I said before  I believe  this medication should be taken consistently and you shouldn't miss many treatments.  Missing treatments has made me extremely groggy and lazy.  So caution to not taking it on the weekends.  I have noticed that when I continued treatment for 7 days a week I didn't have the haze  groggy and lazy feeling.  Also I reduce my dosage to half during the weekends. I hope this helps all in some manner.

I've lost 30 pounds! i have no desire to eat at all. i have to literally force myself to eat. this medicine has helped me sooo much. in high school i got D's and F's. i just finished college and was top in my class  straight A's! bad side effects
NicoleMSM,1/24/2008 21:33,(25-34),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,9,I started on 10mg 2x/day  and steadily increased to current dose of 30mg 2x/day. Although it doesn't work like it used to  I can't function without it. It tends to make me a little irritable and anxious at times. Within the last 6-8 months I've noticed leg pain  tingling  and swelling. I'm unsure if it's related to medication. I've tried other meds but none has helped. Side effects can be annoying  but benefits are worth it.
jjmanning,1/24/2008 5:54,(19-24),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,5,5,5,7,This has been a miracle drug for me. I suffered from SWSD  Major dep. disorder  obesity  an other afflictions  and adderall seems to alleviate them all. The one draw back is it does give me panick attacks  but it far outweighs the side effects.

I love this medication.. dont know what i would do without it.

,1/15/2008 21:39,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,10,With other treatments  I couldn't tell a difference at all in myself(33 yr old woman) or my son (14 yrs). aftertalking to my son  I decided to talk to my doctor about stopping meds altogether  since they are also very expensive. He wanted to try adderol first. I can definately tell a difference when I take my medicine  & when I do not. My son was held back last year at school & at semester they moved him back up  so Im contributing alot of that to the adderol.

AlwaysSleeping,1/9/2008 22:14,(25-34),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Recurring Sleep Episodes During the Day,3,3,5,23,I don't have Narcolepsy but something close. My apologies with my spelling but my problems is called ideo-pathic-hyper- somnia. This just means there is no explanation for why this is the way that I am. I have taken test after test  2- overnight sleep studies and 1 -three day sleep study. My results have been seen by many specialtist and nothing. I am on 30mgs -3 times a day totalling 90mgs of adderall and 20 mgs of ritilin /3 times a day totalling 60 mgss a day and with both of these I can still sleep and sleep hard. I go through good days and bad days or sperts. The bad days or sperts out do the good days. I have tried every drug possible and every strength  I have tried anti-depressants  narcoleptic medications and nothing works. At first adderall was wonderful and gave me my life back  but it has been almost 3 years and it just doesn't do it anymore. It helps slightly but I have to force my self to do anything and everything. I don't know what to do anymore. I am willing to try anything  I just want to be normal again  I want to be able to play with my kids  I don't want to be cranky anymore. I want to live  I am to young to be this old. Can anyone help.

It wasn't diagnosed until March '07 and that's when my Dr. gave me Adderall. It gave me my life back. I started on 20mg/day  now I take 40mg 3/day. It took a couple of months to find the right dosage and level off. I would have to write a book to explain what I was going through  and what I was putting my family through...so I will spare you of that. But don't take this drug just to lose weight  it's a serious medication with some side effects. Go on a diet.

I have all A's in college and beforeI started taking it I was almost being pushed to drop out of high school by my schools administration. It tastes REALLY bad to me thats the only bad thing  they should make it in a capsul maybe? But it's been life changing in an amazing way for me. I no theres been some negitiveity about the drug lately but this drug helps so many people  I believe people need to be more caucious while taking Adderall but the lives Adderall is improving is amazing. It's really a breakthrough drug for people with ADHD.

Fred,12/13/2007 3:51,(25-34),Male,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Other,5,5,5,28,"I took this medication because of my ADD problems in high school. My doctor originally started me off with a drug that is almost exactly Ritalin. I started with it in freshman year due to my lowly grades and noticeable problems. I started using the ritalin like drug  but saw no satisfying results. It also seemed to be correlated with having sleeping problems  appetite loss  and depression. So i stopped using it. When i went to my doctor and told him about  it he seemed to realize that the ritalin wasn't causing the stress and other problems  but it was just the the troubles of freshman year. The drug and my problems weren't actually connected. My doctor prescribed adderall for me in my sophomore year  and i almost instantaneously saw the improvements  faster reaction time  less daydreaming  and i could keep my grades up and remember my work with ease. Luckily i had parents that trusted me enough to let me keep the medication in my own place(in my room) because i was ashamed at first to have to take something to make myself better. It was as if it kind of lifted a disability completely off of my shoulders. Ive taken it all the way through college and stopped when i graduated  i experienced no real withdrawal  I just had to make a smooth transition which my doctor helped me with greatly. If taken in the right doses and not obsessed about it seems to be a very good help for my future and self esteem.
Just realize that what you see as depression and other related things could very well be the much more stressful and much more dangerous thing called high school."

I've taken adderall when i was in high school and then went off the medication for about a year. During that year my grades went from A's and B's to C's or below. Its not that i wasn't a hard worker  i just couldn't concentrate on school work. Its a great medicine and works if used correctly. There are a few complications with it if you take 40 mg or higher for a long period of time (i.e-years) i have read that there is a possiblity of heart complications. But if you stay at a healthy dose and don't go overboard..it works. Also  adderall XR is great b/c you only have to take it once a day  instead of twice a day."
,12/10/2007 18:05,(19-24),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,13,"I have to say that I was very weary of using a drug for my adult ADHD (inattentive type) but adderall really makes my life alot easier. Though adderall is not a ""silver bullet"" it greatly helped me reach my potential as a college student. In high school I went undiagnosed and subsequently untreated which resulted in my sub par grades. It wasnt until college when I talked to my pyschiatrist who throughly evaluated me and first tried me on Ritalin which made me extremely tired  then finally Adderall. Adderall and therapy have allowed me to stay focused and acheive more than I ever dreamed possible. I'm now on the deans list with a 4.0 in my senior year of college. I was also really lucky to not really have any side effects or withdrawl symptoms  although if I take it too late in the day I have a hard time falling asleep  but thats to be expected from an amphetimine."

,12/3/2007 22:15,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,14,Adderall has helped me immensely with my schoolwork.  As a college student  I thought it was normal to be unable to focus on my professors in class or to have trouble finishing my papers or reading homework assignments.  I would often become so obsessed with the details of a project I would not be able to finish and become discouraged. Adderall keeps me focused in class and helps me get my homework done in a timely matter. Now I don't procrastinate because I am confident that I will be able to perform successfully.
honeywell,12/2/2007 13:20,(55-64),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,12,my attention and focus has changed so much since I started taking adderall xr.I can focus instead of sitting at my desk at work and trying to figure out what to do next and since I started taking the adderall I do not use the internet at work.
Persimmon,12/2/2007 11:36,(55-64),Female,Patient,6 months to less than 1 year,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,3,2,27,"This drug seems less harsh than ritalin  but it still causes a down feeling as it wears off. Nonetheless  - perhaps 50%+ of the time Adderall has been quite helpful in getting me in focus and on track.That is a great benefit because I find myself restlessly pacing much of the time and unable to initiate or complete projects  Often I have felt too defeated to even hoppe to begin a project. I have lived with thisa painful condition for 20 years or more. 
When I do dfocus i can becaome very effective and creative. It has been a strained interior battle to find ways to establish a balance and a rhythm in daily life.
I also take the antidepressant Cymbalta and often I also need to take Artivan.
So  it is a frustrating story. Adderall is a great help when it helps  and yet i worry about dependence and also the apparent habituation.
All medications for mood and behavior seem to offer complicated trade-offs requiring frequent self-evaluation and consultation with doctors and also with friends and family. Often I feel embarrassed that I seem to need these types of medicines  and yet is  clear that for me they are helpful and also 
problematic."

I've tried 10mg/day in 2 doses and also 10mg/day in 1 XR (extended release) dose.  It has been incredibly helpful.  I get more done in 1 day than I used to in a week or more.  My husband doesn't come home to find me in the middle of 10 unfinished ""projects"".  The 2 major downsides for me are the addictiveness and the loss of appetite.  I am a mess if I don't take it  and I am naturally a very small person to begin with  so the loss of appetite can be a pretty serious problem.

,11/27/2007 18:05,,,None,None,Other,3,4,5,25,The main problem with Adderall is that it is extremely addictive. I started taking it to help me get through classes and work. I loved that it killed my appetite. I thought I'd be able to take it in moderation  but I take it everyday now. I just feel like a happier person when I take it. But I've noticed that I am distant and easily annoyed if I take too much. Sometimes I feel that I'm on the verge of having a panic attack. If I take 15 MG a day and I eat I feel amazing. But its very easy to avoid eating and take 30 MG because you just get so much done. Im very nervous that I will become strongly addicted to the drug. Im also nervous that I will loose too much weight. Scary.

Robert K,11/23/2007 11:28,(45-54),Male,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,31,Adderall has worked very well for me. My thought process is much more organized and my ability to stay focused on a conversation and tuned into the subject at hand has improved immensely.  I have over the years tried to slow and constrain my hyperactivity with lorasapam and other sedatives with only a moderate amount of success; major side effect was drossiness and fatigue. I looked into the possibilities of Adderall after speaking with a coworker who was prescribed Adderall several years ago and how he was able to continue his education due to his ability effectively concentrate.  After reading more about the symptoms associated with ADD it seemed to be a perfect match to my condition. This medication has reduced much of my public speaking inhibition; I find that I am more out going  in control  less critical of my self  and more inclined to participate in meeting and activities with minimum anxiety. My sexual drive is actually more enhanced. I am taking 5mg three times daily  but am still adjusting the dosage to alleviate side effects (inability to fall asleep at night) and achieve the maximum benefit. This has been an extremely positive life changing treatment for ADD.

,11/18/2007 12:29,(25-34),Female,Patient,2 to less than 5 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,47,This drug has been a life saver for me. I am the typical ADD patient. My mind was racing in a hundred directions at once so I wasn't able to focus on anything. Addy helps me slow down and focus my brain enough to acutally complete the tasks I need to and to do it efficiently. Of course  in the beginning  I got a few side effects - dry mouth  appetite loss  diarrhea (dont take with coffee - TRUST ME)  and some insomnia. I also found myself craving cigarettes for some odd reason. I found that if I ate a meal before taking it in the morning that it almost eliminated most of them. After a few months your body will get used to it. I DO recommend that if you don't need it on the weekends that you don't take it. That way  your body won't be as likely to get addicted to it. I've been taking it for 4 years and I LOVE IT.
newguy,11/18/2007 1:57,(25-34),Male,Patient,less than 1 month,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,28,I have always been successful in life  but at extreme measures (which I thought were normal).  After finding out my older brother had ADHD I started looking into it. What I found was I was a dead on case. So it's been 2 weeks on Adderal and it has made my life easier on every level. Keep in mind it is a stimulant so follow the dose and be true to yourself and talk with your doctor about your reactions on the drug.  Sleep and appetite our at times and issue  but remember to eat frequently and don't take adderall near bed-time. The positives far out weigh anything else. You can actually go thru life and take things as they come.  It doesn't have to feel like you against the world when facing tasks  challenges etc.  A+ for this...
kilacalli,11/16/2007 9:08,(25-34),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,4,5,5,38,After trying a few different similar drugs I found that this worked best. With others I lost weight and felt sickly 24/7 (sick to my stomach  weak  lightheaded  dry mouth  just generally terrible). I started taking Adderall  initially in a VERY small dose and I noticed significant improvement. My doctor and I played with the dosage and I'm so happy with the result. The ONLY set back is feeling jittery every now and again. The best solution for that is just to make sure you're eating an appropriate amount. Not tons  but just spread out small meals and snacks and this won't pose a problem. Eating this way is way more healthy anyways. So now I can focus and feel very optimistic about getting things done everyday instead of dreading everything and having no energy  will or attention to finish things (school work). Great drug. I was very nervous to start taking it because I normally refuse all medicine... but this REALLY helped. Just be careful with dosage and eating.

He is having severe mood swings (bordering bipolar disorder)  is paranoid  violent  irrational  and unpredictable.  He refuses to consider that it is the medication.  I have noticed a pattern with him;  each time he has a big project at work that he needs to put in a lot of overtime on  he takes excess amounts of the Adderall.  Each time this happens  we have huge and dangerous fights  often started over some minor incident.  For instance  he accused me of being an irresponsible wife  mother  parent because I did not walk the dog every day.  I'm seeing a therapist regarding how to deal with his changes in behavior and irrational and volitile temperment.

He is frightening and although he is under the treatment of a psychiatrist he is worse than before he went to this psychiatrist who prescribes and analyzes his childhood but does not deal with the present behavior.

On top of that  it had an adverse effect on my sexual performance and decreased my sex drive considerably.  This isn't to say it won't be effective for others  but it simply wasn't for me.

,10/30/2007 19:14,(13-18),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,3,3,5,17,I like that I can actually listen to a person and hear the whole conversation for the first time in my life. Adderall has also helped with my constant fidgeting. The thing I don't like about it though is that when I'm put into stressful situation I feel more anxiety than before I started the medication. And so far  even though I understand others better  I still find it challenging to process my own thoughts quickly and effectively. I have so many things popping into my head that its all just a jumble and I cant get my ideas out in a way that works for others. Maybe thats just because I have only been taking it for a few months or am not on the correct dosage yet. Dont let it defer you.

She has had no side effects. From hoping that she would graduate high school to her being a top student in college  it has been amazing.
Savnrse,10/16/2007 20:40,(19-24),Female,Patient,5 to less than 10 years,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,1,3,5,24,As an adult female who has been taking this drug for years I would warn against it. It works well for me  although it took a long time to find the correct doseage-10mg  but I could NEVER imagine giving this to a child. I am on a low dose and I really feel side effects. Such as tenseness  irratation  lightheadedness  and I just am not myself when I take it. Although the drug does work  I would only recommend it for adults that know their bodies well and know how and when it works for them. It does have sexual side effects as well. For those looking for something for a child  look for something other than these meds  they are NOT for children!

lollielox,9/22/2007 6:05,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Other,3,4,5,6,I was prescribed this medication to help alleviate my anxiety and to help control my racing thoughts. Overall  the drug worked alright.

Depression and loss of self esteem set in but once diagnosed and on medication I was able to slow down  concentrate and finish jobs. I never realized how my mind raced from subject to subject until I was on medication - 4 years now.
,9/20/2007 8:14,(19-24),Female,Patient,1 to 6 months,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity,5,5,5,68,It was a wonder for me! I had spent tons of money in medical bills and doctors visits only to realize that what I was battleing with was adult ADHD. This hadn't been as much of a problem for me when I was younger until my job had changed drastically and I lost my ability to focus. Work was terrible and my performance was slipping which made me seem deppressed. Once I started on the medication  it has been like I am a different person. I don't give up on tasks  I complete them  I listen to people when they talk to me and overall I accomplish the goals I set forth each day. Thank God my doctor finally listened when others did not.
